### Chapter the Second: In Which Odilon Goes Shopping and the Universe Sends Him a Bill

— A. Octagon

✦

*Observation 0: If I am a scientist, I must go where the data is. Even if the data smells like hummingbirds.*

✦

*Observation 1: The ground is not the ground. It is a fold in something larger. Walking on it causes it to consider alternatives.*

*Observation 2: Have been walking for four minutes. The fold has considered seven alternatives. Three of them were the ground. The other four were suggestions.*

*Observation 3: The pencil has written Observations 1 through 7 already. I am currently writing Observation 3. This is fine. Everything is fine. Methodology is a direction.*

✦

A. Octagon was, by training and by temperament, a creature who believed in sequence. First this, then that. Observation, hypothesis, experiment, conclusion. Breakfast before lunch. Tuesday before Wednesday. One thing at a time, in the order things happened, because the order things happened was, in Flatland, the order things happened.

She would like it noted that the order things happened is not, here, the order things happen.

The accordion trees are breathing.

She had thought, when she first saw them, that they were trees in the way that Flatland had trees — fixed, rooted, decorative. This was incorrect. They are not fixed. They are not rooted. They are, at best, *suggested*, and the suggestion keeps changing. They fold and unfold in rhythms she can almost follow — bellows-rhythms, lung-rhythms — and every time they fold, the air thickens with hummingbird green, and every time they unfold, the green disperses into something lighter, almost transparent, almost the colour of a question.

They are the lungs of this place.

She has written this down. The Fermat pencil has written it down more precisely, six pages ahead, in notation she doesn't recognise yet, which appears to include a colour and a direction and something that might be a small drawing of an accordion, which is not standard scientific notation but is, she has to admit, accurate.

Odilon is walking beside her.

Walking is a generous description. He is *proceeding*, in the manner of a hedgehog who is slightly more hedgehogs than usual, through a landscape that is folding around him with the particular courtesy of a place that has noticed it has a guest and is trying, very politely, to be comprehensible.

The corporeality is a courtesy the universe extends to a guest.

She had not understood this immediately. She had looked at the folding origami world and seen mathematics — interference patterns, probability densities, wave functions collapsing and re-establishing with the casual efficiency of something that has been doing this since before efficiency was a concept. Beautiful. Terrifying. Entirely without the kind of edges a notebook can get hold of.

But Odilon looked at the same world and saw — a place. With ground. With trees. With something in the middle distance that looked, from his angle, remarkably like a market.

She looked again.

It was a market.

It was also not a market. It was a series of folds in the origami landscape — deliberate folds, purposeful folds, the kind of folds that happen when a piece of paper has opinions about commerce — and the folds had arranged themselves into something that functioned, from a certain angle, in a certain light, with a certain courtesy toward visitors who needed things to be *things*, as stalls.

She wrote:

*Observation 7: There is a market. The market is a series of deliberate folds. The folds are stalls. The stalls are selling things that are not, in any classical sense, things. Odilon is already heading toward it. He has the expression he gets when he suspects lunch might be involved. The expression is hopeful. The expression is going to be disappointed.*

✦

The Market of Superpositions was not its name.

It did not have a name. Names require a thing to be one thing long enough to be called it, and the market was not, at any given moment, one thing. It was the probability of a market. It was the space where exchange happened, or might happen, or had already happened in a direction A. Octagon's notebook couldn't point.

But it functioned as a market, the way the between-spaces functioned as a room. It gathered. It provided a place to come to. It gave the creatures of this world — and A. Octagon was not yet ready to call them creatures, because the word *creature* implied a solidity that was, here, at best a rumour — somewhere to be, together, in the specific way that beings who are mostly probability and potential be together.

Which was: loosely. Overlappingly. With a great deal of ambiguity about where one ended and another began, which was not, here, a problem. It was a feature.

Odilon entered the market the way he entered most things — nose first, at a pace that suggested both curiosity and the lingering hope of sandwiches.

A. Octagon entered the market the way she entered most things — notebook open, pencil ready, five-sided and methodical and entirely unprepared for what happened next.

What happened next was apples.

✦

*Observation 8: The stalls are selling states.*

*Observation 9: Correction. The stalls are not selling. The stalls are offering. The distinction matters because selling implies a transaction with a beginning and an end, and here, beginnings and ends appear to be the same fold viewed from different angles.*

*Observation 10: The nearest stall is offering what I am choosing to call an apple, on the grounds that it is round and red from one angle and round and green from another and round and a concept from a third, and I need to call it something.*

*Observation 11: Odilon has looked at the apple.*

*Observation 12: There is now one apple. It is green. The stall appears to be sulking.*

✦

The problem with Odilon in the Market of Superpositions was not that he was rude. Odilon was never rude. Odilon was courteous in the way that hedgehogs are courteous — quietly, pricklily, with a nose that noticed things and a fundamental orientation toward lunch that harmed no one.

The problem was that Odilon *looked*.

In Flatland, looking was free. You could look at a thing all day and the thing would remain, stubbornly, itself. Shapes were shapes. Pencils were pencils. The Provost was a very large Dodecagon whether you observed him or not. Looking was how you understood. Looking was how A. Octagon had sat in the market square for seventeen mornings and built a science out of watching.

Here, looking was expensive.

Here, looking had *consequences*.

Odilon looked at the apple and the apple decided. All the possible apples — the red and the green and the conceptual and the seventeen others that existed in superposition, each of them a perfectly valid apple, each of them real in the way that possibilities are real when they haven't been forced to choose — all of them collapsed into one.

One green apple.

Slightly bruised.

The stall — which was a fold in the origami and also, A. Octagon now understood, a gluon — the stall *felt* this. The stall was the binding that held the apple-states together, the relationship that allowed seventeen apples to coexist in the same fold, and Odilon's looking had, without malice, without intent, simply by being the kind of creature that perceives things one at a time, broken that binding.

The gluon-stall re-folded itself.

It did this with the particular patience of something that has had tourists before. Not many. Not often. But enough to have developed, in its deep structural way, the equivalent of a sigh.

Odilon picked up the green apple.

He sniffed it.

It smelled, A. Octagon noticed, of hummingbird green coffee beans, which was either the natural smell of quantum apples or the default scent of everything here, the way cedar was the default scent of everything Odilon, which was an observation she was not yet prepared to follow to its conclusion.

Odilon bit the apple.

The crunch was singular, definitive, and slightly sad, in the way that all choices are slightly sad if you understand what was lost in the choosing.

Odilon did not appear sad.

Odilon appeared to be experiencing a satisfactory apple.

*Observation 13: Odilon has eaten the apple. The gluon-stall has recovered. It is re-superposing its stock with the weary efficiency of a shopkeeper reshelving after a child has been through. I do not think the gluon-stall holds this against Odilon. I think the gluon-stall finds him — the word I am looking for is endearing but I do not have a column for endearing.*

*Observation 14: The currency here is attention. This is not a metaphor. To look is to spend. To observe is to commit. Odilon has been in the market for six minutes and has already collapsed four apples, two things that might have been bread, and something that I suspect was a sandwich but which, upon being observed, turned out to be a philosophical position on sandwiches, which tasted of the abstract concept of bread, which is not bread, and Odilon's expression when he bit into a philosophical position on sandwiches was — I need a new column. The column is labelled: hedgehog betrayal.*

*Observation 15: I have just realised why the pencil writes the conclusions first. In a world where looking changes things, the only safe observation is the one you've already made.*

✦

A. Octagon walked through the market with her notebook held very carefully in front of her, the way one might hold a shield, her eyes on the fold-ground, which had at least given up on alternatives and was just being ground.

The gluon-stalls held their wares with the particular attention of beings whose entire existence was the act of binding. They were not behind their stalls. They were not beside their stalls. They *were* their stalls — the structural relationship that allowed disparate states to coexist in proximity without collapsing into one sad bruised apple. They were, A. Octagon realised, the answer to a question she had never thought to ask in Flatland: what holds things together?

Not gravity. Not geometry. Not the Provost's fourteenth angle.

Relationship. Binding. The act of relating, made structural, made load-bearing, made into something you could, if you were a courteous universe accommodating a visiting hedgehog, sit at and pretend to order lunch.

She wrote:

*Observation 19: The gluon-beings are not beings in any sense the Academy would recognise. They are relationships that the universe has given the courtesy of form, because we are here, and we need things to have form. When Odilon looks at a gluon, he sees a creature who is very good at holding things. When I look at a gluon, I see a high-energy exchange pattern binding quark-analogues into coherent states.*

*We are both correct.*

*This is the most difficult observation I have ever written.*

✦

Something landed on Odilon.

He had been ambling through the market with the contented air of a hedgehog who has eaten a satisfactory apple and collapsed only four additional items since the last one and was beginning to feel that this place, while confusing, had potential. The gluon-stalls re-superposed their wares behind him with minimal fuss. The accordion trees breathed. The fold-ground had mostly given up on alternatives and was just being ground, which Odilon's feet appreciated.

A flicker at the edge of vision — prismatic, purposeful, like a lens flare with somewhere to be — and then a weight. Not a heavy weight. The weight of light deciding to land. It settled on his quills, and where it touched them, the quills split its light into tiny rainbows that scattered across the fold-ground like the shadows of something too bright to look at directly.

A. Octagon stared.

She had been noticing the flickers since they arrived — prismatic movements at the periphery, always gone by the time she turned to look. The photon-beings. The carriers of seeing. You could not look at light. You could only look at what light showed you.

But light, apparently, could land on a hedgehog.

More of them came. Settling on Odilon's quills the way birds settle on a branch — lightly, with an air of having chosen this particular perch for reasons of their own. Each one split through his quills into colour, and Odilon stood in the market looking faintly bewildered and entirely prismatic, casting tiny rainbows in every direction, and A. Octagon noticed — she noticed because noticing was what she did, even when noticing was expensive — that where the phireflies landed, his quills *vibrated*. Not the vibration of a startled hedgehog. A finer vibration. A hum. As though each quill were a string being gently plucked by the light passing through it.

She did not know what to do with this observation. She filed it.

*Observation 20: The photon-beings — I am calling them phireflies because they are fire and flight and ph and I have decided that naming things is also a methodology — the phireflies have landed on Odilon. His quills are prisms. He is scattering rainbows. He does not appear to mind. His quills are vibrating at a frequency I cannot measure but can almost hear, a faint hum, like a string after it has been struck, and I am noting this without understanding it because some observations are seeds and you do not know what they are until later.*

✦

And then Odilon found an edge.

He had been standing in his small cloud of phireflies, slightly rainbow, slightly humming, when something at the junction of two folds caught his attention. Where the origami creased against itself in a way that was not quite a corner but was, to a hedgehog whose fundamental orientation was toward the precise improvement of edges, close enough.

An edge.

Not a clean one. Not a precise one. An edge that was, like everything here, several edges at once — a fold that couldn't quite decide what angle it was, a crease in the origami that blurred between states, existing in superposition the way everything here existed in superposition, which was beautifully and ambiguously and with no particular need to resolve.

Odilon's nose twitched.

A. Octagon, who had been writing Observation 22 (concerning the particular shade of green the accordion trees produced on their third fold of the minute), looked up.

She recognised that twitch.

She had seventeen mornings of data on that twitch. She had seen it in Flatland, in the market square, before the sharpening of the ceremonial pencil, before every quietly improved corner. She had catalogued its precise characteristics — the angle of the nose, the set of the quills, the particular stillness that preceded the act of making something more precisely itself.

The twitch that meant: *this needs its edges seen to*.

She knew what was about to happen.

She opened her mouth. She reached — not physically, not with her hand, but with the part of her that was seventeen mornings of careful observation and one impossible journey and the instinct, sudden and sharp, that the rules here were different and the twitch that was kindness in Flatland might be something else entirely in a world where precision had consequences —

"Odilon," she said.

Too late.

He did not hear her, or did not listen, or did not understand that the rules here were different, which was the same thing said three ways, and the answer to all of them was: he sharpened.

He pressed his nose to the blurred edge.

He did what he had always done. He found the most precise version of the thing. He sharpened it to its most essential self. He made it, with the particular care of a hedgehog who has been doing this for ten thousand worlds, *exactly what it was*.

One thing.

The fold screamed.

Not a sound. Not exactly. A. Octagon saw it — the way a scientist sees, even when seeing is the last thing she should be doing — she saw the pattern. Every shimmering state the fold had been, every possible angle it had held simultaneously, every version of itself it had been free to be — she saw them narrow. The way light narrows through a slit. An interference pattern — wide, beautiful, all those overlapping possibilities casting their complex shadows — snapping to a single bright band. One line where there had been a symphony of lines. One state where there had been all states.

The loss of it was visible. The loss of it was the shape of everything that wasn't there any more.

The market went still.

The accordion trees stopped breathing.

The phireflies lifted from Odilon's quills — all at once, all of them, the way an audience stands when something has gone wrong — and the rainbows went with them and he was just a hedgehog again, just quills and a cold nose and the terrible precision of what he had done.

The gluon-stalls — those patient, structural, load-bearing relationships — the gluon-stalls looked up. They should not have been able to look up because they were tables, but corporeality was a courtesy and the courtesy had just flinched, and in the flinch there was something that looked very much like a face, and the face was not angry.

The face was sad.

A. Octagon stared at the edge Odilon had sharpened.

It was perfect.

It was the only dead thing in the market.

Odilon sat back.

He looked at the edge.

He looked at the stalls, with their courteous faces, and their sadness, and the way the superpositions around the sharpened fold had pulled back from it the way water pulls back from something too hot.

He looked at his nose.

His nose had done this. His nose, which had sharpened the word *harm* very gently. His nose, which had pressed to the other side of a membrane while a five-sided creature waited with her palm and her courage and her fear. His nose, which was the instrument of everything he was and everything he did and which had, in ten thousand worlds, never once made anything worse.

He did not understand what he had done.

But he understood, in the small warm part of him that noticed things without meaning to, that the market was quiet in a way it should not be, and the quiet was his fault, and the edge was perfect, and perfection was, here, a kind of violence.

He made a sound.

Not a sneeze. Not a word. A small, involuntary sound, the kind a creature makes when it discovers that the best thing about itself is, in a new context, the worst.

A. Octagon closed her notebook.

She had known. She had seen the twitch and she had known and she had been one breath too slow, one observation too late, and the fold was dead and she could not un-know that she had almost stopped it.

She did not write this down.

She sat down next to him on the fold-ground, which held steady beneath them both.

Some observations are not for notebooks.

✦

*Observation 23, written later, much later, when the accordion trees had started breathing again and the gluon-stalls had quietly re-superposed the space around the sharpened fold, covering it gently the way you might cover something sleeping, or something hurt:*

*The edge is still there. It is still perfect. The market has learned to move around it the way a stream learns to move around a stone.*

*Odilon has not sharpened anything since.*

*He has not eaten anything since, either, which is, for Odilon, the most alarming development I have recorded in seventeen mornings of data collection and one extremely long afternoon.*

*Observation 24: My pencil has written something on the next page that I have decided not to read yet.*

*Observation 25: The accordion trees are breathing again. The green is slightly different. Softer. The way a room smells different after someone has cried in it.*

*Observation 25b: That is not a scientific observation.*

*Observation 25c: I am keeping it anyway.*
