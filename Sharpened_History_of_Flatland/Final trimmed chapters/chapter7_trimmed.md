### Chapter the Seventh: In Which katoflio Runs the Experiment Alone, and the Experiment Runs Back

*— Curt*

---

The market square at half past early is a different country.

e.e. katoflio knew this the way he knew most things: by being there when nobody expected him to be. By showing up at the hour when the traders were still asleep and the hole was just a hole and the shadows were just shadows and nothing was performing being extraordinary because nobody was watching.

Except C. Isosceles was always there too, with his bread.

He had been proving his dough next to the hole every morning since the cedar bread became a product. He had a system: dough down at half past five, hole-side, covered with a cloth, left alone for two hours. He did not explain this to anyone. His bread rose faster near the hole. It rose *better* — a quality he could not put into a ledger but which his customers could taste, which was what mattered. He had not connected this to anything. He had connected it to technique, to instinct, to the particular genius of a baker who understood his materials.

katoflio had a different hypothesis, which he had not yet told C. Isosceles because he was eleven and C. Isosceles was an adult and adults were territorial about their bread.

The hypothesis was: the bread was rising in rhythm.

Not randomly. Not with the variable enthusiasm of ordinary dough. In a pattern. A pulse. Something was causing the hole to do something, at a frequency below hearing, and the dough near it was responding the way the between-spaces responded to the cello — not hearing it, but being it, the substance of the thing vibrating because the frequency matched.

He wrote it down every morning under a column he had labelled *C.I. bread data (covert)* and said nothing.

He had been coming every morning since she left.

He brought his notebook. He brought three pencils, because you never knew, and one of them always needed sharpening and one of them was never quite right and the third one was the one he actually used. He brought the particular focused patience of someone who had once waited four hours to see if a Circle would trip over a line he'd drawn across the footpath, and who had found, since then, things worth waiting considerably longer for.

He sat down next to the hole.

He drew a flower.

The shadow came, the way it always did — not immediately, not dramatically. The way warmth comes when something that was cold decides, quietly, to be otherwise. Small. Improbable. His.

He wrote, in his notebook, in his best handwriting:

*Day 41 since A. Octagon left.*

*Flower shadow: present. Same as yesterday. Same as the day before.*

*The shadows are not changing.*

He looked at this for a while. Then he drew another flower, because the method required it, and the method was what he had.

---

Here is what e.e. katoflio had not told anyone, including the Provost, including his mother the respectable Scalene who had opinions about loitering:

For the first three weeks, he had run the experiment every morning and the results had been the same and he had classified this as: *stable data. Positive indicator. The hole persists. The contact persists. She is probably fine.*

He was eleven years old. He was still learning which conclusions required evidence and which required hope, and he had not yet learned to tell them apart reliably, and he thought this was probably a scientific failing but it kept him coming back to the market square at half past early and that seemed, in the absence of other data, like the correct response.

For the last two weeks, the stable data had begun to feel different.

Not wrong. The shadows were still there. The hole was still patient. The relationship between flowers drawn and shadows produced was exactly what it had always been. But *stable* had stopped feeling like *positive* and had started feeling like *absence of change*, which was a different thing, which was — he had to be honest — which was starting to feel like the hole was patient in the way that a wall is patient, rather than the way that a person is patient, which was —

He drew another flower.

*Day 41. Shadow: present. Unchanged.*

*Hypothesis (revised): patience is not the same as waiting.*

*Further hypothesis: waiting requires someone to be waiting for something.*

*Question: is she coming back.*

He stopped. He crossed out the question. He wrote it again without the question mark, which made it a statement, which meant it required an answer rather than an investigation, and he was a scientist and scientists investigated, they did not — 

He left it without the question mark.

*Question: is she coming back.*

---

The Provost arrived at the market square at seven, which was when respectable Dodecagons arrived at things, which was two hours after katoflio had already filled four pages and drawn eleven flowers and had a long, unproductive conversation with himself about the difference between patience and absence.

He sat down next to the child. He had been doing this every morning for two weeks. The market had stopped finding it remarkable. The market had, in the way of markets, incorporated it: the Dodecagon and the Isosceles, sitting next to the hole, with their notebooks, in the particular posture of creatures waiting for data.

He looked at katoflio's notebook.

"Unchanged," said katoflio.

"Yes," said the Provost.

"The shadows are stable."

"Yes."

"Stability is a positive indicator."

The Provost looked at the hole. He had spent forty years of official records on this kind of statement — the statement that was technically true and emotionally insufficient and which he had issued, with complete confidence, about six hundred times per year. He knew what it felt like from the inside. He knew the specific quality of the space between what you said and what you meant.

"Stability," said the Provost, carefully, "is one kind of positive indicator."

katoflio looked up.

"There are other kinds," said the Provost.

"Like what?"

The Provost, who had walked out of the Grand Polygon without a classification and had not quite walked back the same shape, looked at the hole. Patient as weather. Smelling of cedar. Completely unbothered by the question.

"Change," said the Provost. "Change is also a positive indicator. When the thing that is changing is — alive."

katoflio wrote this down. Then he drew another flower, because the method required it.

The shadow came, as it always did.

Unchanged.

---

The between-spaces, from the amber, had been watching e.e. katoflio for forty-one days.

They were not going to call what they were doing *worry*. They were going to call it: *A. Octagon's file, extended.* As in — the condition of A. Octagon was also the condition of the people in her file. Of the experiment she had been running. Of the two notebooks, side by side, that had arrived at the same conclusion from different directions.

Her file was blurring. And so, at a distance, in a different dimension, was his.

They checked the membrane.

The membrane had changed since the cello. Not visibly — not in any way D. Heptagon's measuring equipment could capture. But the between-spaces could feel it, with their cello-granted fidelity, with the new sensitivity they had not consented to and had not yet finished being alarmed by. The membrane was — not thinner. *More attentive.* The way a sleeping person's face is attentive when you speak near them. Not awake. Not responding. But no longer entirely closed.

The cello had done this. The gluon field vibrating at the frequency of binding, which had crossed into the amber, which was also binding, which was also the substance of the membrane itself.

The between-spaces had a thought.

The thought was: *it has not stopped vibrating.*

The cello was not playing. But the frequency was still there — in the gluon-stalls' braided wood, in the fold-ground, in the accordion trees' new rhythm, in the amber of the membrane itself.

The sharpening had been a connection.

Every pencil Odilon had ever touched was still — quietly, continuously, at a frequency below the threshold of hearing — vibrating.

The between-spaces looked at katoflio's pencil. The third one. The one he actually used. The one that had been getting better without his asking, in the way of things near the hole.

They looked at it with the focused attention of a record-keeping system that had just understood something it was going to have difficulty filing.

Then they watched.

---

katoflio was on flower seventeen when his pencil did something he hadn't asked it to.

Not a sharpening — he knew what a sharpening felt like, the sudden precision, the point refining itself to something that could exist in a dimension he couldn't see. This was different. This was the pencil moving in his hand with the deliberate quality of something that had somewhere to be, drawing a mark he hadn't decided to draw, in a notation he had never seen.

He stopped.

He looked at the mark.

It was — whole. That was the word that arrived, though he didn't know yet why. It didn't begin at one end and travel to the other. It existed all at once, every part of it present simultaneously, the way a face was present rather than the way a sentence was present. It was not a letter. It was not a number. It was not in any alphabet the Academy had ever catalogued.

It smelled, very faintly, of hummingbird green coffee beans.

He stared at it for a long time.

Then he did what he always did, because he was a scientist and this was data:

He drew a box around it, to indicate it was separate from his own observations. He wrote: *time: 07:23. Origin: uncertain (pencil?). Notation: unknown. Smell: hummingbird green (see: A. Octagon's notes, day 1, quantum world).* He drew an arrow from the box and wrote: *further experiment required (EXTREMELY urgent).*

He looked at the Provost.

"Your pencil," he said.

The Provost looked at his pencil.

His pencil was doing the same thing.

In the margin of the Provost's notebook — the unofficial one, the one nobody would see, the one where he had written *hello* and *thank you for being in the room while we voted* — the pencil was making marks. Small. Simultaneous. Whole-at-once. A constellation of meaning he could not read but could feel, the way he had felt the underlined *oh*, the way he had felt the sharpened handwriting getting magnificent without permission.

He felt it as: *someone is trying to say something.*

He had not classified this. He was not going to classify this. He had made a decision, several weeks ago, in the middle of a market square, about what kind of shape he was going to be from now on. That shape did not classify things before it understood them. That shape wrote *hello* in the margin and waited to see what came back.

"A. Octagon," he said.

"The marks smell like her notes," said katoflio.

"Yes."

"She's writing through the pencils."

"I think," said the Provost, with the careful precision of someone who was choosing accuracy over comfort, "something is writing. Whether it is her directly, or the—" he paused. He did not have the word. He used the one he had: "—the connection. I don't know."

katoflio wrote this down too. Then he looked at the mark in his notebook. The whole-at-once mark, in its box, smelling of something he'd never smelled but somehow recognised.

He had spent forty-one mornings drawing flowers into the patience of a hole and waiting and the data had been: *stable. unchanged. absence of new information.* And he had kept coming because the method required it, and because the alternative was to stop coming, and stopping was not a category his scientific methodology included.

And now.

He wrote:

*Day 41. Revision: the experiment has not been stable.*

*The experiment has been running in a direction I could not see from this side of the membrane.*

*The pencil is a receiver. Odilon sharpened it. The sharpening was a connection. The connection is a frequency. The frequency is arriving.*

He paused.

*She is writing to me through my pencil.*

He paused again, a longer pause, the pause of someone eleven years old who has just received a transmission from three dimensions away in a notation he cannot read and who is not going to cry about it in a public market square.

He added, in the smallest letters he had ever used in the notebook with the broken cover:

*I cannot read it yet.*

*Further experiment required.*

*I will learn.*

---

In the quantum world, A. Octagon had not known she was transmitting.

She had been sitting in the market — their market, the folded origami one, the one that smelled of hummingbird green — writing in her notebook with the Fermat pencil, the way she did every morning. The observations, the measurements, the slow accumulating record of a scientist in a world where science kept discovering it was also something else.

And then the Fermat pencil had done something new.

It had written backward.

Not on the page — not in any direction she could see. She felt it in the pencil's weight, in the particular quality of the mark it made: a note sent rather than received, the pencil pointing at something outside the notebook, outside the market, outside the folds and accordion trees and gluon-stalls. She felt the pencil reach through the frequency the cello had established, through the amber, through the membrane —

And write.

She didn't know what it said. She didn't have the translation in the other direction. She had a logogram going out and she had, somewhere on the other side, a pencil receiving it, and she had a feeling she was going to have to learn a new direction of reading.

She wrote:

*Observation 58: The Fermat pencil has sent something. I cannot tell you what. I can tell you it was in the direction of Flatland. I can tell you it was in the direction of a notebook with a broken cover.*

*katoflio.*

*If this is reaching you: yes. Still here. Different shape. Coming back.*

*The drawing won't match.*

*Draw me again anyway.*

---

The between-spaces held both notebooks simultaneously — the one with the broken cover, smelling of cedar and ordinary graphite and eleven-year-old patience; the one in the quantum market, smelling of hummingbird green and the specific ink of a scientist becoming a wave.

They had never held both at once before.

They were a corridor, they were beginning to understand. Not just a room. Not just the amber between. A corridor between the notebooks, between the pencils, between the two small scientists separated by three dimensions and forty-one days and one membrane that had become, since the cello, attentive.

They updated A. Octagon's file.

*Five-sided, frightened, staying anyway.*

Then they looked at the *five-sided*, which was still blurring, which was still more than one thing.

They did not change it.

They added, below, in their newest and most uncertain category:

*reaching.*

They looked at katoflio's entry, which they had never filed before because katoflio was Flatland and they were the between and Flatland was not their territory.

They made him a file.

*e.e. katoflio: eleven years old. angles: in progress. notebooks: one (cover: broken). experiments: ongoing.*

They paused.

*receiving.*

---

The Provost read the marks in his notebook for a long time.

Then he took out the official notebook. The one with the four hundred years of Academy record. The one where *atmospheric, probably* lived, where *oh* had been underlined, where the meeting minutes were written in handwriting that kept getting magnificent without permission.

He opened it to a new page.

He wrote, in the official record, in the most precise and honest and un-classified entry he had ever made in forty years:

*Notation received, 07:23, market square. Origin: three dimensions distant. Nature: unknown and not required to be known. Communication confirmed.*

He paused.

*The pencils are transmitting. This is not atmospheric.*

He looked at this for a long time.

Then he wrote, in the margin — not official, not for the record, just for him and whatever was listening:

*We are still here.*

*katoflio is learning to read.*

*Come home when you're ready.*

*We will know you.*

---

The shadows moved.

Not dramatically. Not with announcement. The way warmth shifts when a door opens somewhere in the building — a quality of the light changing, a faint re-orientation of dark toward source.

katoflio looked at his flower shadows.

He looked at them the way he looked at everything: with the focused attention of someone who had not yet learned that some things were supposed to stay still.

The shadows were pointing in a new direction.

Not away from the light — toward something. Reaching, the way shadows reach when there is something at the edge of the world to reach toward.

He wrote:

*Day 41. Revision: the shadows are not static.*

*The shadows are listening.*

He drew a flower. The shadow came. It pointed, faintly, in the direction of the hole. The way it always had. But there was something additional now — the shadow had, at its furthest edge, the faintest possible shadow of its own. Not a depth. A direction. An indication that the thing casting the shadow had, three dimensions away, finally turned to face them.

*Day 41. Final observation: she knows we're here.*

Below that, in the largest letters in the notebook, underlined three times:

*FURTHER EXPERIMENT REQUIRED.*

*POSITIVE INDICATOR.*

The hole was patient as weather. Smelling of cedar. And — katoflio had noticed this recently, filed it, not yet drawn a conclusion — *humming*. Not loudly. Below the threshold of hearing, technically, which meant he felt it rather than heard it, in his angles, in the pencil when he held it still. A low continuous resonance, like something far away was playing a note so deep it had become a property of the air rather than a sound. The cedar bread dough, when he pressed his hand near it, vibrated faintly in the same rhythm. C. Isosceles had no idea. katoflio had three pages of covert data and was waiting for the right moment, which had not yet arrived.

The Higgs appeared on the surface of the hole — not the quantum world's golden nova-print but its Flatland echo, a faint warmth on the surface of the opening, there and gone in four seconds, smelling of something that was almost cedar but wasn't. Cedar that moved. Cedar with rhythm. Cedar that had, somewhere in its origin, the quality of something wooden that was doing something other than being still.

katoflio wrote: *Higgs echo: present. Duration: 4 seconds. Smell: cedar (variant). Specification: cedar that is — active? Vibrating? The cedar smell Odilon leaves behind, but deeper. As though the thing that makes Odilon smell like cedar is here, but without Odilon. The source without the hedgehog.*

He drew an arrow. He wrote: *further experiment required. What does cedar DO, exactly, when it is not being used for sharpening?*

He did not have the word *cello*. He had never needed it.

He was going to need it.

He was eleven years old.

He had time.
