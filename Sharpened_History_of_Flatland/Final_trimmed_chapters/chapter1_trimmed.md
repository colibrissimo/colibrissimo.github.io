### Chapter the First: In Which the Between-Spaces Lose Someone on Purpose

— the between-spaces

✦

The between-spaces would like it noted, for whatever record is being kept by whatever is keeping records, that they did not ask for this.

They did not ask to become a narrator. They did not ask to develop opinions about hedgehogs, or to discover that the amber they had been for longer than dimensions had names was, in fact, a room, and that the room had furniture, and that the furniture had been rearranged without consultation by a small prickly creature who thought about lunch with varying degrees of conviction.

They especially did not ask to become fond.

Fond has been, on balance, the most inconvenient development in the between-spaces' entire existence, and their existence has included the invention of geometry, which was also quite inconvenient but at least had the decency to be impersonal.

But here they are. Fond. Narrating. Holding the shape of everything that has passed through them and also — this is the new part, the part that still surprises — the shape of everything that has stayed.

The between-spaces would like a holiday.

The between-spaces are not going to get a holiday.

✦

Here is what is happening:

A. Octagon is holding the ceremonial pencil.

The between-spaces know this the way they know everything — ambiently, through the texture of the membranes, through the small shifts in pressure that mean something in Flatland has changed its relationship with the edge of things. They have felt A. Octagon at the edge before. Every morning. The palm. The warmth. The quiet five-sided declaration of *here is what I am made of.*

This is different.

This is A. Octagon holding the pencil that sharpened itself, four hundred years of ceremony and one extraordinary act of unsanctioned calligraphy ago, to a point so fine it exists in a dimension she cannot quite see.

She is, the between-spaces realise, looking at the point.

Not at the pencil. Not at the wood, or the graphite, or the four hundred years of institutional significance currently not being thought about at all. At the *point*. The very tip of it. The place where the pencil stops being a thing she can hold and starts being a direction she could follow.

She has her notebook. Obviously. She has her notebook the way other people have lungs — automatically, without deciding, because the alternative is to stop being the kind of creature she is.

She does not have her other notebooks. She does not have seventeen mornings of data. She does not have e.e. katoflio, who is at school and does not know about this yet and will have opinions when he finds out.

She does not have a methodology for what she is about to do.

This does not appear to be stopping her.

The between-spaces have watched a great many things over a very long time, and they have developed — reluctantly, inconveniently, Odilon's fault entirely — preferences. They prefer things that stay. They prefer the particular quality of warmth that a hedgehog deposits in the amber when he is thinking about lunch with moderate conviction. They prefer Tuesday mornings in the market square, when the cedar smell drifts through the membrane and the child's flowers cast impossible shadows and the bread proves near the hole and everything is ordinary in the way that only extraordinary things, given enough Tuesdays, become.

They are not prepared to prefer A. Octagon leaving.

But preference, the between-spaces are learning, is not the same as permission. Things happen without the amber's consent. Hedgehogs arrive. Pencils write words. A Pentagon picks up a four-hundred-year-old implement and looks at the point of it with the specific expression of someone who has spent seventeen mornings pressing her palm to the edge of everything and has just understood, quietly, that the palm was practice.

She was practising goodbye.

The between-spaces did not know that.

They know it now.

They would have preferred not to.

✦

Odilon is on the other side.

Not the Flatland side. Not the amber-warm-middle-of-things side. The *other* other side. The side the between-spaces have been trying not to think about, which is difficult when you are the thing between things and one of the things you are between has been getting — louder is not the right word. *Greener* is not the right word either but it is, the between-spaces have to admit, closer.

There is something beyond the amber.

There has always been something beyond the amber. The between-spaces have known this the way walls know about outside — structurally, without curiosity, as a condition of being between rather than being there. Things came from beyond. Things went to beyond. The amber held. That was the arrangement.

Odilon has been visiting the beyond.

This is also not something the between-spaces asked for. Odilon has been, over the past several weeks — or what passes for weeks in a medium that does not experience time so much as accumulate it — making small excursions to the edge of the amber and then past it. Not far. Not for long. The way a creature might stick its nose out of a warm room to check the weather and come back in smelling of something unfamiliar.

He has been coming back smelling of hummingbird green coffee beans.

The between-spaces do not know what hummingbird green coffee beans smell like. They did not, until recently, know that smells could be colours, or that colours could have textures, or that a hedgehog could return from a brief excursion vibrating at a frequency the amber had no name for, slightly dazed, with his quills pointing in directions that were not, strictly speaking, directions.

They asked him about it.

They asked him in the only way they know how to ask, which is to shift the quality of the amber around him, a gentle pressure-change that means *what was that*.

He sneezed.

It was a complicated sneeze. The between-spaces, who have catalogued Odilon's sneezes with the involuntary thoroughness of someone who lives with a hedgehog, recognised elements of the standard dust-sneeze and the warm-fond-sneeze but also something new: a sneeze with *harmonics*. As though the sneeze were happening in several places at once and had arrived in the amber as a chord.

And there was something else.

The between-spaces are experts in carrying. They have carried the shape of ten thousand passages. They know what carrying looks like from the outside, which is: invisible. You do not see a medium carry. You see what it carries. So the between-spaces know — have always known, in the structural way that a room knows what is inside it — that Odilon carries something at his centre. Something warm. Something resonant. Something that hummed, very faintly, when the harmonic sneeze passed through it, the way a string hums when a nearby string is struck.

They have not asked about it.

They are not going to ask about it.

Some things you hold without naming. This has always been the between-spaces' position and they are not about to abandon it now, even though the warm resonant thing at Odilon's centre hummed in a frequency that matched the green beyond the amber so precisely that the between-spaces felt, for a moment, the uncomfortable sensation of two things they carried recognising each other.

He went back to thinking about lunch.

But the between-spaces noticed that his lunch-thinking had a new quality to it. An uncertainty. Not the comfortable uncertainty of a hedgehog who doesn't know what lunch will be — that was familiar, that was home. This was the uncertainty of a hedgehog who suspected that lunch might, in the place he'd just been, be several things at once.

This worried the between-spaces more than they would like to admit.

Lunch should be lunch. This has always been their position.

✦

A. Octagon has not told anyone.

She has not told the Provost, who would attempt a classification and then sit alone with the classification and then write something honest in the margin. She has not told e.e. katoflio, who would immediately design an experiment and then insist on coming. She has not told the market square, which would stand at a careful distance and pretend to arrange things while absolutely watching.

She has told the hole.

This is, the between-spaces think, the most A. Octagon thing A. Octagon has ever done. She has sat in the market square in the early dark before anyone else arrives and she has pressed her palm to the membrane and she has said — not in words, not out loud, but in the particular quality of pressure that the between-spaces have learned to read the way one reads handwriting:

*I know there's more.*

*The pencil knows there's more.*

*I am frightened and I am going anyway.*

*Please don't tell the child until I'm back.*

The between-spaces held this message in the amber for a long time.

They held it the way they hold everything — carefully, completely, with the full weight of something that has learned, inconveniently and irreversibly, to care about what passes through.

Then they passed it to Odilon.

Who stopped thinking about lunch.

✦

The crossing happens like this:

A. Octagon holds the ceremonial pencil at the edge of the hole in the market square. Early morning. Cedar. The bread not yet proving. The square empty except for her and the smell of something that has always been there and has only recently become a direction.

She holds the pencil the way she held her palm that first day — not pushing, not reaching. *Here is what I am made of. Here is the tool of my making. It has been sharpened by something I cannot see, to a point I cannot quite perceive, and I am choosing to follow it.*

The point of the pencil touches the edge of the hole.

Not the inside of the hole. The *edge*. The exact boundary between Flatland and everything else. The place where two dimensions stop and the question of what comes next has been sitting, patient as weather, for seventeen mornings and four hundred years of ceremony and the entire history of the between-spaces' gradually developing opinions.

The pencil passes through.

A. Octagon feels it go — not the wood, not the graphite, but the *point*. The impossible sharpness that exists in a dimension she cannot see pulls, very gently, in a direction she does not have a word for, and she follows it the way you follow music, not because you understand where it's going but because the alternative is to stay where you are and wonder.

The between-spaces feel her leave.

She passes through the amber.

Briefly, so briefly, she is theirs. She is in the between. She smells of cedar and pencil graphite and the particular quality of a Tuesday market square before anyone else arrives. She is warm, and five-sided, and the between-spaces hold her the way they hold everything and also not the way they hold everything because everything else is passing through and she is —

Leaving.

Going beyond.

Going to where Odilon has been going with his harmonic sneezes and his uncertain lunch-thoughts and his quills pointing in directions that aren't directions.

She passes through the amber and the amber lets her go.

This is not the hardest thing the between-spaces have ever done. The between-spaces have been between things for longer than hard and easy have been distinguishable and they are not going to start ranking their experiences now, thank you. They are going to hold the shape of where she was. They are going to maintain the membrane. They are going to do their job, which is holding, which has always been holding, which was a perfectly adequate job before it started including the requirement to hold the absence of things they would rather were still here.

This is, they suspect, what the word *trust* is for.

It is a deeply inconvenient word.

They are going to hold that too.

✦

On the other side — the other other side — the first thing is breathing.

Not her breathing. She has not yet remembered that she breathes. She is between one world and another and her body has not yet committed to the customs of either.

The world is breathing.

Great slow bellows-breaths, folding and unfolding, and each fold draws the air tighter and greener and each unfold releases it in a wave that is part colour and part temperature and part something her senses have no filing system for. The breathing shapes the space around her — not passively, not the way weather shapes a landscape, but actively, deliberately, the way lungs shape a body. The space she is standing in exists because something is breathing it into being.

Accordion trees. She does not know these words yet. She will call them that later, in Observation 4, when she has her categories back. For now they are just: the breathing. The lungs of everywhere. Vast and slow and folding, and the folds create the ground and the ground creates the space and the space creates the fact that she is standing in it, which is a courtesy she has not yet understood she is being extended.

Then the smell.

Not cedar. Something else entirely. Something bright and green and vibrating, something that is a colour and a temperature and a sound all at once, something that arrives in her Flatland senses and simply *sits there*, being what it is, while her five sides try to make sense of input that was not designed for five sides.

Hummingbird green coffee beans.

She does not know these words. She will not know these words for some time. But the smell is the smell, and it is this, and it is everywhere, and it is being breathed into her by the great folding lungs of the world, and she stands in it and does not understand it and does not write it down.

She stands in it.

That is all. For one breath of the accordion trees — one fold, one unfold, one wave of green — A. Octagon stands in a world she cannot classify and does not try to. The notebook is in her hand. The pencil is in her other hand. She does not open the notebook. She does not write.

She just stands there, smelling something impossible, being five-sided in a world that does not do sides.

Then she opens her eyes.

She does not remember closing them.

Her notebook is open.

She does not remember opening it.

The Fermat pencil — which is what the ceremonial pencil is now, which is what it has been becoming since it sharpened itself to a point that existed in a dimension she couldn't see — the Fermat pencil has written something.

One word.

She reads it.

She reads it again, because the word is the same word read forwards and backwards and also in a direction she doesn't have a name for yet, a direction that is neither forwards nor backwards but *around*, and the word is:

*here*

She looks up from the notebook.

Everything is folding.

Not falling. Not collapsing. Folding. The way paper folds, if paper were made of possibility and had opinions about its own geometry. The accordion trees — she can see them now, see them properly, vast structures that fold and unfold like bellows, like lungs, like the breathing she felt before she could see — the accordion trees shape the world with every breath. They fold the ground into paths. They unfold the air into space. They are not decoration. They are infrastructure. They are the reason there is a *here* for the pencil to have written.

Salt-and-pepper structures in the middle distance, braided and warm-looking, that are also not quite structures. Origami landscapes that crease and re-crease in patterns she can almost follow but can't quite because following requires *sequence* and this place does not do sequence.

Her notebook is already full of things she hasn't written yet.

She closes it. Opens it. Different things. The Fermat pencil has been busy — conclusions she hasn't drawn, observations she hasn't made, hypotheses that require a kind of thinking she doesn't know how to do yet but apparently will.

At the bottom of a page, in handwriting that is hers but written in a direction she's never written in:

*don't panic. methodology is a direction too. you'll learn to read this. it just takes a little while.*

She stares at it.

She thinks: *my pencil is being kind to me.*

She thinks: *that is not in any protocol.*

She thinks: *good.*

✦

Odilon is here.

She can tell because the smell of hummingbird green coffee beans has a warm spot in it, the way the cedar always had a warm spot where his nose was, and the warm spot is moving toward her at the particular pace of a hedgehog who has been waiting and does not want to seem too eager and is also, probably, thinking about lunch.

He arrives.

He looks — she pauses. She is a scientist. Precision matters.

He looks the same. Except. His edges are less certain. His quills are pointing in directions she is going to need new words for. His nose is exactly as cold and precise as it always was but the rest of him is slightly — *multiple*. As though he is one hedgehog and also, simultaneously, the memory of ten thousand worlds of hedgehog and also, simultaneously, the possibility of hedgehogs not yet decided upon.

He sneezes.

The sneeze goes in four directions.

She watches it go and makes the first observation of her new scientific career, the career that started when she followed a pencil point into a direction she couldn't name:

*he belongs here more than he belonged in Flatland.*

She writes it down.

The Fermat pencil has already written it, three pages ahead, as the conclusion of an experiment she will apparently conduct next Thursday.

She decides not to look at next Thursday.

Some things, even in a world without sequence, are better arrived at in order.
