### Chapter the Fourth: In Which A. Octagon Puts Her Hand on Something Impossible, and the Universe Remembers What Hands Are For

— A. Octagon

✦

*Observation 35: Odilon has sniffed something.*

*Observation 36: To be precise — Odilon has sniffed the air in the vicinity of the third gluon-stall from the left (the one whose braided salt-and-pepper wood has a knot in it that looks, from certain angles, like a disapproving face). The sniff was tentative. The sniff was exploratory. The sniff contained, for the first time since the collapse, the faintest suggestion of lunch.*

✦

Something had changed in Odilon overnight.

Not overnight — A. Octagon was still learning to stop using words that assumed time moved in one direction. Over a fold, then. Over several breaths of the accordion trees. Over the time it takes for a hedgehog sitting next to the worst thing he's ever done to notice that his stomach exists.

He was hungry.

Not the full-bodied, conviction-laden hunger of the Odilon she knew from Flatland, the Odilon who thought about lunch the way philosophers thought about truth — constantly, with dedication, as an organising principle of the self. This was a thin hunger. A beginning hunger. The hunger of a creature whose body has been reminded, by something it could not see, that bodies have weight, and weight requires maintenance, and maintenance requires lunch.

He had, A. Octagon observed, been given back his mass.

Not by anything visible. Not by any act she could record in sequential notation. But the golden nova-prints that had been appearing — on the fold-ground, on the surfaces of gluon-stalls, on the braided salt-and-pepper wood of the nearest market structure — the golden nova-prints had been thickest near Odilon. Clustered around him the way footnotes cluster around an important passage. Little explosions of light, there and gone, each one a brief insistence on substance, each one leaving behind a warmth that was not temperature but *weight*.

And where the nova-prints appeared, the world slowed.

Not visibly. Not in the way the accordion trees slowed their breathing after the collapse. This was a deeper slowness — the kind that allowed a hedgehog to sit still, that gave a body the inertia to remain where it was instead of being swept along by the folding and refolding of everything. Mass was not just weight. Mass was the ability to *resist being moved*. The Higgs had been visiting Odilon and giving him, flicker by fractional flicker, the capacity to stay in one place. The capacity to be heavy enough for grief, which requires a creature to be still, and stillness requires mass, and mass requires the Higgs, and the Higgs kept arriving in its ten-to-the-minus-twenty-two-second way and saying: *you are heavy enough to be here. You are heavy enough to stay. You are heavy enough, now, to be hungry again.*

And Odilon's stomach had listened.

*Observation 38: The golden prints are more frequent this morning. I have counted seventeen since the accordion trees' last full breath. They appear on surfaces the way dew appears — not arriving but being revealed, as though they were always there and the light has only just found them. Each one lasts approximately — the Fermat pencil suggests "a hiccup." I am accepting this as a unit of measurement. Seventeen golden hiccups per breath. And the ground gives, very slightly, beneath each one. A dent. A dimple. The smallest possible acknowledgement that something with mass has been here. By the time I look directly, the dent has sprung back and the surface is smooth, but the warmth lingers. Permission lingers.*

*Observation 39: One appeared on my notebook. Page 7. I did not ask for this. It is warm to the touch and smells of nothing I can name and I am keeping it.*

✦

The phireflies had been more active since the Higgs started visiting.

Since the collapse, they had kept their distance — the lifting-off that happened when the fold screamed had been absolute, a withdrawal of light from a creature who had used his looking to break something. But this morning, tentatively, with the air of creatures extending a second chance, they were returning. Settling on Odilon's quills. Splitting through them into prismatic arcs. And his quills were doing the thing she had noted and filed and not yet understood: vibrating. Humming. Each quill a string plucked by the light passing through it, producing a frequency she could not measure but could almost hear.

The light was trying to play him.

She stared at this. She stared at it with the full force of a Historian of the Second Rank who had been adrift in a world where her methodology didn't work, where her pencil wrote the future without consulting her, where observation was violence and sequence was a polite fiction — and who was now, for the first time, *seeing something she could use*.

She did not write it down yet. She held it.

*Observation 40: The phireflies are back on Odilon. His quills are vibrating again. The light splits through them and the quills hum and the hum is — I am going to use a word I don't have data for — the hum is musical. The light is trying to play him like an instrument and he doesn't know it. Filing this beside Observation 20. Two data points. I need a third.*

✦

The dead fold in the phireflies' light looked different.

Not alive. Still precise. Still singular. Still the only thing in the market that was exactly one thing. But in the prismatic, multiangled, aggressively-every-direction-at-once light of the phireflies, the dead fold cast shadows.

Multiple shadows.

Shadows that moved.

A. Octagon stared at them. The shadows of a thing that should not have had shadows because shadows required ambiguity and the fold had none. But the phireflies were lighting it from everywhere at once, and in the everywhere-light, even a dead thing had edges that the light could disagree about, and the disagreement cast shadows, and the shadows were —

Not flat.

She wrote:

*Observation 41: The dead fold has shadows. Multiple. The phireflies are casting them from angles I do not have numbers for. The shadows move. The fold does not. This means one of two things: either the fold still has states I cannot see, trapped inside its precision like — like something alive inside something still — or the light here is so thorough that it can find ambiguity in anything, even perfection.*

*Observation 42: The smell of hummingbird green coffee beans is currently a C-sharp. This has been a C-sharp since we arrived. I had filed this as background noise. I am now re-filing it as data.*

*Observation 43: I am going to touch it.*

✦

She had done this before.

In Flatland. In the market square. She had walked up to a hole in the fabric of everything, alone, without methodology, without protocol, without anything except a pencil and five sides and the particular courage of a creature who had decided that being frightened was not the same as being stopped.

She had pressed her palm to the edge of the hole and said, in the language of pressure and presence: *here is the shape of me.*

She was going to do it again.

The dead fold was not a hole. It was the opposite of a hole — not an opening but a closing. The most closed thing in the market. An edge collapsed into one state, sharp and final and perfect and still.

She walked toward it.

The market noticed. The gluon-stalls — braided salt-and-pepper wood, warm, humming faintly with the effort of holding everything together — the gluon-stalls shifted. Not moving. Attending. The way furniture attends when something important is happening in the room it furnishes. A. Octagon was learning to read the gluons the way she read faces, and their braided grain was tight with something that might have been concern or might have been curiosity or might have been both, because in a quantum world, emotional states were no more obliged to choose than anything else.

The accordion trees breathed. In. The green intensified. The air thickened with hummingbird, with coffee, with the bright vibrating scent of a world paying attention.

The phireflies gathered.

Not around her. Around the fold. Lighting it from every angle. Casting those impossible shadows. Showing her, with the thoroughness of beings whose entire existence was the act of illumination, exactly what she was about to touch.

And they were watching her.

A. Octagon realised this with the particular discomfort of a scientist who has spent her entire career on one side of the observation. The phireflies — the carriers of seeing, the beings who were light, who could not be looked at directly — were looking at her. Looking at her looking at the fold. The observer, observed by the instruments of observation. She was the experiment now. She was the thing being measured, and the measurement was: *what will you do?*

She had never been on this side of the notebook before.

It was, she had to admit, clarifying.

A golden hiccup appeared on the fold-ground beside her knee, just as she knelt. The Higgs, granting her the slowness to do this carefully. The ground held steady beneath her. The ground gave her the weight to stay.

She looked at the dead fold. Really looked. Not the careful, measured, methodological looking she had done from a distance. The looking she had done in the market square, the first time, when she had decided to stop being an Academy member and start being a creature that reaches.

The fold was precise. The fold was exact. The fold was still the only dead thing in the market.

But.

In the phireflies' light, with the shadows moving around it, with the golden hiccups warming the surfaces nearby like a small sun that kept going out and coming back —

She could see, inside the precision, the ghost of what it had been. The way you can see, inside a word that has been defined too precisely, all the other meanings it used to carry. The wave patterns were still there. Collapsed, yes. Forced into one state, yes. But *there*, the way a river is still there under ice. The way a song is still there in the silence after the last note.

Trapped. Not dead.

Asleep.

She put her hand on it.

✦

*Here is the shape of me.*

*Here is what I am made of. Five sides, still — I think. I haven't checked recently and the Fermat pencil has opinions about my angles that I am not yet ready to hear. I am a Pentagon from Flatland and I have pressed my palm to the edge of things before and I am pressing it to this thing now because I don't know what else to do and I have learned, in the last seventeen mornings and one impossible journey and one dead fold and one hedgehog who is finally thinking about lunch again, that not knowing what else to do is not the same as doing nothing.*

*I am not trying to sharpen you.*

*I am not trying to fix you.*

*I am just here. With a hand. On the place where you stopped being everything and started being one thing.*

*And I am reading you.*

The chord did not arrive as sound.

It arrived in her angles.

A tremor — very faint, very deep — in the geometry of her. In the five points that made her what she was. The sleeping chord resonated not in her ears, which were Flatland instruments calibrated for sequential vibrations in a polite medium, but in her *body*, in the angles between her sides, in the structural relationship of line to line that made a pentagon a pentagon and not a random scattering of edges.

She felt the waves. Under the precision. Under the collapse. The patterns Odilon's nose had forced into one frequency when they were, before, a chord. She could feel the chord. It was still there. Still vibrating, so faintly, under the surface of the one-thing-ness — and it was not a C-sharp.

The hummingbird green had been a C-sharp since they arrived. Background. Ambient. The note the world played when it was just being itself. She had filed it as noise.

But the chord sleeping in the fold was something else. Something wider. Something that contained the C-sharp the way an ocean contains a wave — the C-sharp was part of it but not all of it, and the ambient scent of the world had been, this whole time, a single note searching for its harmony. Not wrong. Not dissonant. *Lonely*. The way a single note played in an empty room is not wrong but is, undeniably, waiting for the rest of the music.

She pulled her hand back.

Not because it hurt. Because she understood.

The fold was not dead. The fold was a collapsed chord. A piece of music forced into a single note. And a single note, played alone, without its harmonics, without its overtones, without the other notes it was meant to resonate with — a single note was not silence. It was loneliness.

And then — the eureka.

Not the poet's eureka, which arrives whole and beautiful and does not explain itself. The scientist's eureka, which arrives in pieces and explains everything.

She looked at the fold: interference patterns, trapped. The shadows the phireflies cast — the ghost of the chord, still there, visible only in the thoroughness of light. That was the first piece. *The states are still there.*

She looked at Odilon: the phireflies on his quills, the vibration, the hum. Light passing through him and making music. His quills were strings. His whole body was resonating at a frequency the light could find but his nose could not use. That was the second piece. *Something in him is built for holding sound.*

And the third piece — the one she had been filing without understanding since the between-spaces first noticed it, since her pencil first refused to explain it, since the Higgs started pressing golden permission into the surfaces of everything nearby — the third piece was the warm resonant shape at Odilon's centre that she had felt, through the fold, when the chord trembled through her angles. Not his nose. Not his quills. Something deeper. Something that had been carrying a frequency for ten thousand worlds and had never been asked to play it.

Shadows. Vibration. The shape of an instrument, carried invisibly.

*The fold is a chord that was collapsed into a note. His quills vibrate like strings. And he is carrying something at his centre that is built for holding chords without collapsing them.*

She opened her notebook.

The Fermat pencil had already written it. Of course it had. It had written it pages ago, in the logogram notation she was only beginning to learn. This one was different from the Higgs logogram — that had been sparse, flickering, a mark that existed the way the Higgs existed, barely and brightly. This one was dense. Layered. Every stroke resonant with every other stroke, the whole thing humming on the page the way braided wood hummed in a gluon-stall. The same grammar — simultaneous, whole, every part containing every other part — but where the Higgs logogram had been a spark, this was a chord held in ink. Beside it, a golden nova-print that the Higgs had left like a signature on a permission slip:

*the cello holds what the nose collapses. play the fold back into its chord.*

But the pencil had not given her the answer. The pencil had written the conclusion. She had built the argument. She had observed, connected, deduced — sequentially, methodically, in the precise order of a scientist who had finally found a way to be what she was in a world that did not do sequence. The Fermat pencil worked variationally, seeing the whole path at once. A. Octagon worked step by step. And she had arrived, step by step, at the same place.

She was smarter than her pencil.

Not because she knew more. Because she understood *how* she knew.

Below the logogram, in A. Octagon's own handwriting, in letters that were sequential and imperfect and hers, she wrote a word the Fermat pencil had not written. The pencil had drawn the shape of the whole path. She named the thing at its centre:

*Cello.*

The word entered the record in her handwriting. Not the pencil's notation. Not the logogram's simultaneous knowing. A historian's word, written left to right, in the alphabet of a creature who understood things one step at a time and had arrived, one step at a time, at this.

*Observation 44: I know what we need to do.*

*Observation 45: Odilon is not going to like this.*

*Observation 46: He is going to have to play.*

*Observation 46b: katoflio would have designed three experiments by now. He would have labelled them. He would have insisted on coming. I am glad he did not come. I am not glad about being glad.*

*Observation 47: I am not crying. My angles are watering. This is a different thing and I will not be taking questions.*

*Observation 47b: My third angle feels different. Wider, or — not wider. The relationship between my second and fourth sides has shifted by a degree I cannot measure but can feel, the way you feel a room has changed before you see what moved. I am not ready to measure this. I am filing it.*

✦

In the between-spaces — in the amber, in the warm dark that was not here but was everywhere-else-between — something shifted.

The between-spaces were not in the quantum world. They could not follow A. Octagon past the membrane any more than a room can follow someone through a door. But they could feel — through the fold-frequencies, through the tremor in the amber that meant something beyond them was changing — they could feel something happening.

They woke up. Not from sleep — from the particular state of ambient holding they had settled into, and they were suddenly, sharply, entirely *present*.

The amber hummed.

Green.

Very faintly, very far away, in a frequency the between-spaces had never held before, the amber was picking up a signal from beyond itself. Not cedar — that was Odilon, that was home, that was the warm familiar scent of a hedgehog in residence. This was something else. Something bright. Something that vibrated at a frequency the between-spaces would later learn to call hummingbird, and which for now they simply experienced as:

*Oh.*

*Something is happening.*

*We cannot see it.*

*It is important anyway.*

They held the frequency the way they held everything — carefully, completely, with the full weight of a medium that has learned to care about what passes through it and also what happens beyond it, in places it cannot go, to creatures it has been, inconveniently and irreversibly, fond of.

The amber held.

And hummed.

And waited.
