### Chapter the Eighth: In Which the Academy Convenes Its Forty-Seventh Emergency Session, the Classification Committee Encounters a Notation It Cannot File, and C. Isosceles Is Called as an Expert Witness

*— Curt*

---

The between-spaces would like it noted that they did not call this meeting.

They are also noting it because the meeting is, from the amber, extremely interesting.

---

The Provost arrived at the Grand Polygon at nine o'clock on a Tuesday, which was when emergency sessions began, which was also, and this was not a coincidence, which was also *Tuesday* — the specific Tuesday quality of a day when the ordinary has incorporated the extraordinary and both are just getting on with it.

He arrived with katoflio.

This required some explanation, which the Provost was not going to give.

He had collected the child from the market square at eight-thirty, where katoflio had already been for three hours and had filled six pages and drunk two cups of something warm that C. Isosceles had brought him without being asked, because C. Isosceles was, beneath the bread and the ledgers, a person who noticed when small scientists had been in the cold since half past five.

"You're bringing me," said katoflio. Not a question.

"You have the data," said the Provost.

"I have a notebook with a broken cover."

"Yes," said the Provost.

katoflio looked at him with the expression of someone who was eleven years old and had been treated as a data source before but not usually as a colleague, and who was not entirely sure how to file this but was going to try.

"They're not going to like it," said katoflio.

"No," said the Provost.

"A. Rhombus is going to say I should be in school."

"A. Rhombus," said the Provost, with the particular precision of a very large Dodecagon who has spent two weeks sitting in a market square at half past early, "is not chairing this session."

katoflio wrote this down. He was not sure yet if it was data or reassurance. He filed it under both.

---

The Academy had been avoiding the Provost.

This was not official. There was no motion, no vote, no entry in the record. It expressed itself instead as: urgent prior commitments, rescheduled consultations, a sudden epidemic of administrative tasks that required immediate attention in rooms that were not the market square and did not smell of cedar.

The Academy knew something was happening. The Academy's pencils had been doing things. A. Parallelogram's pencil had been writing in the margins of the classification indices — small marks, whole-at-once, in a notation she did not recognise and had not catalogued. A. Square's pencil had written, during a particularly dull committee on dimensional standards, what appeared to be a small drawing of a hedgehog in the margin of his notes, which he had covered immediately and told no one, because he was still learning which battles to avoid and this was clearly one of them.

None of them had told the Provost.

None of them had told each other.

They had each, individually, opened a private notebook and written *atmospheric* and then sat with the word for a while and then closed the notebook again.

The word had stopped working. It had been working for months, reliably, the way a good tool works — you pick it up, you apply it, the problem acquires a classification and can be moved to a different part of your mind where it requires less maintenance. *Atmospheric.* Filed. Done.

The word had stopped working approximately three days ago, which was when A. Parallelogram's pencil had written, in the margin of the official classification index, under the entry for *cross-dimensional acoustic phenomena (theoretical):*

*not theoretical.*

In her own handwriting. Except she hadn't written it.

She had looked at it for a very long time. She had not crossed it out, because the thing about A. Parallelogram was that she was precise, and precision required that a record reflect what had actually occurred, and what had actually occurred was that her pencil had written *not theoretical* in the margin of a classification index and she had witnessed it. Crossing it out would be imprecise.

She had not told anyone.

She had written, below it, in her own hand, the thing she always wrote when evidence exceeded category:

*Classification pending.*

And then she had gone home and not slept very well.

---

The session was called to order at nine-oh-four, which was four minutes late, which was the first time in the Provost's memory that an emergency session had begun late, and which communicated, without anyone saying it, the collective reluctance of fourteen geometrically significant individuals to begin the thing they had agreed to begin.

The air in the Grand Polygon was different. Not visibly. But the air had a quality — a density, a resonance — that it had not had before the holes, before the cedar, before the pencils began getting magnificent without permission.

A. Rhombus had been sitting with a low-grade acoustic unease for three weeks. He had attributed it, in his private notes, to atmospheric conditions.

The word had stopped working for him too.

He had not admitted this.

The Provost sat at the head of the table.

katoflio sat next to him, which was not a position the table had a precedent for, and which caused A. Rhombus — who was not chairing but who had opinions — to make a shape with his angles that communicated volumes about the Academy's position on non-members attending official sessions.

The Provost looked at A. Rhombus until A. Rhombus stopped making the shape.

"We are here," said the Provost, "because the evidence has exceeded the current classification framework. We require new framework. We are going to build it now, in this room, with the available materials."

"The available materials," said A. Rhombus, "include an irregular Isosceles who is not a member of this body."

"The available materials," said the Provost, "include the most comprehensive dataset on cross-dimensional contact that exists in Flatland. Which is in that notebook."

He indicated katoflio's notebook. The one with the broken cover. 

The Academy looked at the notebook.

The notebook, which had never previously been in the Grand Polygon and which contained forty-one days of flower-shadow measurements, covert bread data, a complete record of logogram appearances, the annotation *do not tell A. Rhombus*, and the largest letters in the notebook: *FURTHER EXPERIMENT REQUIRED*, looked back with the particular blankness of an object that does not know it is in the most important meeting of its existence and would not be impressed if it did.

"The notebook," said A. Square, with the careful tone of someone who has learned to deploy his observations tactically, "has a broken cover."

"Yes," said the Provost.

"The data inside is—"

"The data inside," said katoflio, who had decided that if he was a material he was going to be a useful one, "is forty-one days of shadow measurements, seventeen flower-drawing trials, one shadow-of-a-shadow-of-a-shadow, three pages of—" he glanced at the Provost "—acoustic bread data, and forty-three instances of logogram appearance in pencils near the hole. Cross-referenced with the Provost's official record." He paused. "And one annotation that is personal and not for general distribution."

The silence that followed was the particular silence of a room that has just been outmaterialed by an eleven-year-old Isosceles.

"Acoustic bread data," said A. Parallelogram, with the precision of someone who writes records for a living and therefore must be precise even about things she would prefer not to be precise about.

"C. Isosceles's bread," said katoflio. "It rises in rhythm near the hole. Four-four time. I have been measuring it covertly for three weeks." He placed the notebook on the table, open to the *C.I. bread data (covert)* section. "I did not tell him. The data is, I believe, more reliable because he did not know he was being studied."

C. Isosceles, who was not in the Grand Polygon and was at this moment in his bakery wondering why his morning batch was rising slightly faster than usual, would have had feelings about this.

The Academy looked at the bread data.

The bread data was meticulous. It was, A. Parallelogram noted with the resignation of someone who recognises quality against her will, more methodologically rigorous than several papers published in the Academy's own journal.

"The bread," said A. Square, "is rising."

"The bread is rising in rhythm," katoflio corrected. "There is a distinction."

"Rhythmically rising bread," said A. Rhombus, "is—"

"Not atmospheric," said A. Parallelogram.

The room went very quiet.

A. Parallelogram looked at what she had said. She appeared to be doing calculations — the specific internal calculation of someone who has been holding a word back for three days and has just heard it come out of her own mouth in a room full of witnesses.

"I should note," she said, with precision, "that three days ago my pencil wrote *not theoretical* in the margin of the classification index. Without my direction. In my handwriting." She paused. "I did not report this at the time because I was—" another pause. "Because I was being imprecise about what constituted reportable data."

"You were frightened," said A. Square.

The silence that followed was different from the previous silence. This one had in it the quality of a room in which something true has been said by someone still learning not to say true things in public.

"I was being imprecise," said A. Parallelogram again. "Yes."

---

The Provost placed his notebook on the table. The official one. He opened it to the page that read: *Notation received, 07:23, market square. Origin: three dimensions distant. Nature: unknown and not required to be known. Communication confirmed. The pencils are transmitting. This is not atmospheric.*

The Academy read it.

"This is not atmospheric," read A. Rhombus, aloud, which was unnecessary and communicated a great deal about A. Rhombus's current relationship with the proceedings.

"No," said the Provost.

"You've written this in the official record."

"I have."

"It cannot be un-written."

"That is the nature of official records," said the Provost. "Which is why they matter."

A. Rhombus made the angle-shape again. The Provost looked at him again. A. Rhombus stopped.

"We also," said katoflio, "have the logograms."

He placed, on the table, a separate page from his notebook — carefully removed, the edges crisp, the drawing precise. The logogram. The whole-at-once mark. The thing that was a face rather than a sentence, that existed simultaneously rather than sequentially, that had arrived in his pencil at 07:23 and smelled of hummingbird green coffee beans.

The Academy leaned forward.

"It's — whole," said A. Square.

"Yes," said katoflio.

"It doesn't — begin anywhere."

A. Square stood up. He walked around the table. He looked at the logogram from the left side, then the right, then from the far end of the table, craning slightly. He returned to his seat and looked at it again.

"It's the same," he said, with the expression of someone who has just discovered something obvious and magnificent simultaneously. "From every angle. It doesn't — rotate. It doesn't have a front. It's—" he stopped.

"Simultaneous," said katoflio.

"It's the same thing from every direction," said A. Square. "Which means it's not a sequence. It's not built from a beginning and an end. It simply—" he sat down. "It simply *is.*"

The room absorbed this. A. Rhombus, who had been going to say something dismissive, found that the something had dissolved before it arrived, because A. Square, for once, had said the right thing plainly, and the right thing plainly said had a way of making dismissiveness structurally untenable.

"It is, as best I can determine, the grammar of a different kind of thinking," said katoflio. "I believe it is the notation of a world where meaning is not built in sequence but held in simultaneity. Whole-at-once, rather than one-after-another."

"Like a chord," said A. Square.

A. Rhombus made a shape with his angles. It was not his usual dismissive shape. It was a shape the room had not seen from him before, which was: *I recognise what you are saying and I am not yet prepared to agree with it and I am aware that these are different things.*

Progress.

A very long silence.

"You're eleven," said A. Rhombus.

"Twelve next month," said katoflio. "The notebook is dated."

"The Classification Committee," said A. Parallelogram, who had been looking at the logogram with the expression of someone who has just found a category they have never had to make before and is going to make it with full procedural rigour, "will require a recess."

"Of course," said the Provost.

The Classification Committee — A. Parallelogram, A. Square, and A. Rhombus, who had joined it under protest and who was going to have opinions — convened in their corner.

katoflio watched them.

"Do they always do that?" he asked the Provost.

"Yes," said the Provost.

"Does it help?"

The Provost considered this carefully, as he considered everything now, since the market square.

"It helps them," he said. "The classification is rarely the point. The convening is the point. The act of taking something seriously enough to go into a corner about it."

katoflio wrote this down.

---

The Classification Committee returned in six minutes, which was three minutes faster than their previous fastest, which had been the *oh* session, which had been nine minutes and had produced three categories and one of them had been wrong.

"We have," said A. Parallelogram, consulting her notes with the focused precision of someone who is about to say something unprecedented and intends to say it correctly, "identified the logogram's classification."

"Yes?" said the Provost.

"It is, we conclude, a *transmission*." She paused. "Subcategory: *intentional*. Cross-reference: *communication, confirmed*. Further cross-reference—" she looked at the Provost's official record entry — "as documented."

"Atmospheric?" said A. Square, which was either a question or a test and the room was not entirely sure which.

"No," said A. Parallelogram.

A. Square nodded. He had known. He had known since the pencil drew the hedgehog in his margin during the committee on dimensional standards. He had been waiting for the room to arrive where he already was.

"The bread," said A. Parallelogram, "is classified as: *corroborating evidence*. Subcategory: *acoustic resonance in proximate baked goods.* We recommend it be cross-referenced with—" she looked at katoflio "—the bread data. Which should be formally entered into the Academy record."

"C. Isosceles's covert measurements," said katoflio.

"C. Isosceles's measurements," said A. Parallelogram, with precision, "which were conducted in proximity to a confirmed point of dimensional contact and which constitute, we believe, the first documented instance of cross-dimensional acoustic data recorded in a commercial foodstuff."

The room absorbed this.

"He doesn't know," said katoflio.

"He will need to be informed," said A. Parallelogram.

"He's not going to like it."

"He is going to like it very much," said A. Square, with the confidence of someone who has been observing the market square for several months, "once he understands that it means his bread is special. C. Isosceles has strong feelings about his bread being special."

This was, the room conceded, accurate.

---

The vote was called.

Not on atmospheric — that classification was already dead, and everyone in the room knew it, and the decent thing was not to hold a funeral, just to stop using the word and let it retire quietly to the index where it would remain, slightly embarrassed, under the entry for *no longer applicable.*

The vote was on the Provost's proposal, which he had written on a single page, in his magnificent handwriting. It proposed the formal acknowledgment of cross-dimensional contact, ongoing, at the market square. That the transmissions be classified as: Communication. Not atmospheric. That the study be named, in the official record, *The Frequency of Residence Project*.

The Academy read it.

"The Frequency of Residence," said A. Parallelogram.

"Yes," said the Provost.

She looked at the phrase for a long time. She looked at it the way she looked at a classification that was exactly right — the way a key looks when it has found its lock, not triumphant, not dramatic, simply: precise. This was the word for the thing. This was the thing the word had been waiting for.

"That," she said, "is the most accurate description I have encountered of what is occurring."

"Yes," said the Provost.

"I'll write it in the record."

"I know."

"It cannot be un-written."

"That," said the Provost, "is rather the point."

The vote was thirteen to one. The one was A. Rhombus, who raised his angle with the particular resolution of a shape that has decided, regardless of evidence, to be the one.

Nobody argued with him. The Provost looked at him, and A. Rhombus looked at the Provost, and something passed between them that was not quite agreement but was not quite disagreement either — the specific look of two creatures who have each, in their own time and by their own route, been sitting with a word that stopped working, and who recognise the shape of that sitting even in someone still mid-sit.

A. Rhombus went home that evening and opened his private notebook. Not the official one. The one nobody would see.

He wrote: *Frequency of Residence.*

He looked at it.

He did not cross it out.

He wrote, below it, in the smallest letters he had ever used: *not atmospheric.*

He closed the notebook. He sat with the low-grade acoustic resonance that had been in his angles for three weeks. He sat with it differently than he had before — not as an irritant, not as a classification problem, but as a *thing that was happening*. A frequency. A chord in the air of a world that had been, since before he had the word for it, vibrating.

He did not tell anyone.

He came back to the market square the next morning.

He stood at a distance, the way the traders had once stood. He was not watching. He was, he would have said, monitoring conditions.

He was watching.

The between-spaces noted the addition to the list of shapes near the hole and updated their records: *A. Rhombus: condition. Ongoing. Early stage.*

They did not tell anyone either. They simply held it, the way corridors hold the things that pass through them, and waited to see what it became.

A. Square did not start clapping this time.

He did not need to. The room was already holding.

"One more thing," said katoflio.

The room looked at him.

He reached into the notebook — past the flower measurements, past the bread data, past the logogram on its separate page — and he retrieved a drawing. Careful lines. A five-sided shape, each angle precisely 108 degrees, the way a scientist drew it, or the way a child drew it when he was trying to be precise, when he wanted to get it right.

He placed it on the table.

"She drew me a copy," he said. "Before she left. Of the shape she was. So I would have a record." He looked at the drawing. "Her third angle is in superposition. She told me through the pencil." He paused. "She said the drawing won't match when she comes back."

The room waited.

"I'm going to draw her again," said katoflio. "When she comes back. New shape. Whatever shape she is. I need the Academy to know that the new drawing will also be in the official record. Because—" he stopped. He was eleven years old and he did not have all the words yet. He had the scientific ones and the experimental ones and the *further experiment required* ones. He was working on the others.

"Because," said the Provost, "she is still A. Octagon."

"Yes," said katoflio. "She is still A. Octagon. The angles are different. The shape is—" he looked at the logogram again, the whole-at-once mark in its careful box. "The shape is becoming. But she is still her. I know her by—" he stopped again.

"By her staying," said A. Parallelogram.

The room was very quiet.

katoflio looked at A. Parallelogram with the expression of someone who has just had a word given to them that they had been reaching for.

"Yes," he said. "By her staying."

He wrote it in the notebook. In the largest letters. Under the drawing:

*fig. (in progress): A. Octagon. Angles: becoming. Identity: confirmed. Method of confirmation: staying.*

Below that, smaller:

*further experiment required.*

Below that, smallest:

*she is coming back.*

---

The between-spaces updated their records.

*The Academy: reclassified. Category: reaching.*

*Flatland: condition. Ongoing. Positive indicator.*

They left space in the record. Considerable space. The kind of space a record-keeper leaves when they know that what comes next is going to require more than a margin.

*The Frequency of Residence,* they wrote.

*Filed: Tuesday.*

*Classification: not atmospheric.*

*Status: ongoing.*

*The amber holds.*
