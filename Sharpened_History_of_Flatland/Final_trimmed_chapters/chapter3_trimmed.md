### Chapter the Third: In Which Nothing Happens, and It Is the Loudest Thing the Between-Spaces Have Ever Heard

— the between-spaces

✦

The between-spaces have known silence before.

They have known the silence of before-dimensions, when they were not yet between anything and existed in the particular quietness of a medium that has not yet been asked to mediate. They have known the silence of passage — the brief hush that follows Odilon through the amber, the held breath of a world briefly parted. They have known the silence of A. Octagon's palm on the membrane, which was not silence at all but the loudest quiet thing the between-spaces had ever felt, until now.

This is different.

This is the sound of nothing, and it is not silent.

Odilon is not making any noise. The between-spaces would like to emphasise that this is not, in itself, unusual. Hedgehogs are not, as a rule, noisy creatures. Odilon's primary contributions to the ambient soundscape have always been limited to: sneezing (various), the soft percussive padding of hedgehog feet on amber (comforting), and the sound of thinking about lunch, which is not technically a sound but which the between-spaces have come to experience as a low warm hum, somewhere between a purr and the memory of bread, and which they would not admit to missing, if asked, except that nobody is asking, because Odilon is not making any noise.

He is not sneezing.

He is not padding.

He is not thinking about lunch.

The between-spaces know he is not thinking about lunch because the low warm hum is gone. And the gone-ness of it is not silence. The gone-ness of it is a shape. A hole in the sound of things, the exact dimensions of a hedgehog thinking about lunch with conviction, and the between-spaces can feel the edges of it the way a tongue finds the place where a tooth was — not by touching what's there but by mapping what isn't.

This is what nothing sounds like: it sounds like the thing that's missing.

The accordion trees are still breathing, but softer. Their green has gone quiet — not the vivid hummingbird of before the collapse, not the bright vibrating green that was also a temperature and a C-sharp. A muted green. The green of a room after something has happened in it that nobody is talking about. Their bellows-rhythm has slowed, each fold and unfold careful, gentle, the way you breathe around someone who is sleeping or someone who is hurt, and the between-spaces cannot tell which, because Odilon is sitting by the dead fold and he is neither sleeping nor hurt, he is something else, something the between-spaces do not have a word for, something that is maybe the thing that comes after hurt when hurt has finished being sharp and has become, instead, a weather.

The between-spaces can hear the shape of what's not there.

It is, they would like it noted, extremely loud.

✦

He is sitting in the market.

Not at a stall. Not near a stall. Near the fold.

The dead fold. The one he sharpened. The one that is still, even now, perfect and precise and exactly one thing, while the market moves around it the way a stream moves around a stone, covering it gently with new superpositions that form and dissolve and re-form in the patient, breathing rhythm of a world that has been hurt and is choosing, without drama, to keep going.

Odilon is sitting next to it.

He is doing the thing the Provost did. The between-spaces recognise it from Flatland — the specific quality of a creature sitting with something it cannot classify and does not know how to undo. Except the Provost was sitting with *oh*, and Odilon is sitting with the knowledge that his nose is, in this particular fold of the universe, a weapon.

The between-spaces would like to tell him that weapons are a matter of context, and that a nose which sharpened the word *harm* very gently is not suddenly a weapon because the room has changed.

They cannot.

Odilon has gone somewhere they are not — not physically, not dimensionally, but *emotionally*, which is a direction the between-spaces did not know existed until approximately seven minutes into their acquaintance with A. Octagon's palm, and which they have been finding increasingly inconvenient ever since.

He has gone quiet, and the quiet has a direction, and the direction is *inward*, and inward is not a place the between-spaces can follow. Inward goes *into* the thing they are holding, and the between-spaces cannot follow it any more than a glass can follow the water it contains into being water. The between-spaces, who have narrated everything from the invention of geometry to the Provost's most intimate hesitation, cannot narrate the inside of a grieving hedgehog, and they find this — they find this —

They find this unbearable, actually, and they would like it noted that *unbearable* is not a word they had any use for before Odilon, and they are adding it to the list of things that are his fault.

They would like, for the record, a holiday.

They would also like Odilon to eat something.

These two desires are, they suspect, related.

✦

A. Octagon is doing what A. Octagon does when things are terrible.

She is writing things down.

*Observation 26: Odilon has been sitting next to the collapsed fold for approximately — the Fermat pencil suggests three hours, four possibilities, and a Tuesday, which I am interpreting as "a while." He has not moved. He has not sharpened anything. He has not looked at anything with intent.*

*Observation 27: The pencil knows what happens next. It has written it, six pages ahead, in the logogram notation I am learning to recognise but not yet to read. I have decided not to read ahead.*

*Observation 28: I am a Historian of the Second Rank. I have spent my entire career building instruments to see further, measure more precisely, know sooner. The Fermat pencil is the finest instrument I have ever held. It sees the future. It has written the answer to every question I have not yet thought to ask. And I am choosing not to read it. For a scientist, this is — I do not have a metaphor. For Odilon, this would be refusing a sandwich while starving. It is the putting-down of the thing that makes you what you are, because using it would be a kind of looking, and looking has broken enough things today.*

*Observation 28b: The pencil is being patient with this decision. I did not know pencils could be patient. I did not know patience could be a direction.*

She is sitting near Odilon but not beside him. This is deliberate. She has learned — is learning — that in this world, proximity is a form of looking, and looking has consequences, and right now the kindest thing she can do for a hedgehog who has just discovered that his looking breaks things is to be present without looking too closely.

She is watching the accordion trees instead.

They are breathing. They have been breathing this whole time, through the collapse and the silence and the market's quiet recovery, because lungs do not stop when things go wrong. Lungs are a stubbornness that precedes opinion. But the green is different. Softer. Muted, the way a colour mutes when it carries grief — still green, still hummingbird, but with the brightness pulled inward, the way a person's voice goes quiet when they are saying something that matters too much to be loud.

A. Octagon finds herself breathing with them, which is not a methodology but is, she thinks, something close to one.

*Observation 29: The accordion trees breathe on a cycle of approximately forty folds per breath. The green is softer now. The way a room smells different after someone has cried in it, or after bread — the first bread, the unexpected bread — has finished cooling and the warmth has gone into the walls and the walls are holding it and you cannot tell, after a while, whether the warmth is the bread or the room.*

*Observation 29b: That was not a scientific observation.*

*Observation 29c: The pencil has underlined it. Twice. I think the pencil disagrees about what counts as scientific.*

✦

And then.

The between-spaces hesitate to narrate this part, because narrating requires a certainty they do not have, and what happened next was not certain. What happened next was the opposite of certain. What happened next was the smallest, briefest, most uncertain thing the between-spaces have ever been asked to hold, and they have held the shape of ten thousand passages and the ghost of every hexagonal hole and the memory of a small cold nose pressed to the membrane of everything.

What happened next was this:

Odilon was not looking.

This is important. The between-spaces want to stress this. For the first time since arriving in the folding green world, Odilon was not observing. Not sharpening. Not attending. Not being the creature whose fundamental nature is to notice things. He was sitting next to the dead fold with his quills pointing in directions that had stopped being several directions and had become, simply, down, and he was not looking at anything.

And because he was not looking —

Something was free to arrive.

✦

Higgs.

Not a name. Not yet. The between-spaces do not know this word yet. What they know is: a shift. A weight in the nothing. The particular quality of substance arriving in a place that did not expect substance, the way a room that has been empty suddenly has someone in it, not because you heard them come in but because the air is different, because the space is *occupied*, because something that has mass — however briefly, however fractionally — is here.

Here.

And then not here.

And then here again.

The between-spaces hold their breath, which is a thing they did not know they could do, and which they suspect they learned from the accordion trees, and which they are going to blame on Odilon because everything is Odilon's fault, including the between-spaces' increasingly complicated emotional landscape.

Here.

Not here.

Here. For a fraction of a moment — for ten to the minus twenty-two seconds, or one fold of the accordion trees' smallest breath, or the time it takes for a hedgehog to not-think about lunch, which is shorter than you'd expect and longer than it should be —

Here.

Something with weight. Something that gives weight. Something whose entire existence is the act of making other things *substantial*, of granting mass to the massless, of saying *you are heavy enough to stay* — and it cannot, itself, stay. It flickers. It arrives and departs in the same moment, a graffiti-tag of gravity on the walls of the not-quite, a scrawl of *I was here* that lasts no longer than the writing of it.

Odilon does not see it.

But he feels it. The way you feel someone sit beside you in the dark. Not the sound or the sight but the *weight*. The shift in the distribution of things-that-are-here. A presence measured not in quills or angles or even warmth but in the most fundamental unit available: mass.

Something, for a fraction of a fraction of a moment, was heavy beside him.

And the warm thing at his centre — the thing the between-spaces had noticed and not named, the resonant shape he had carried through ten thousand worlds — responded. Not loudly. Not dramatically. A hum. The way a cello body hums when a low note is played in the same room, not because anyone has touched the strings but because the wood recognises the frequency and answers it. The mass arrived, and something inside Odilon remembered what heaviness was for.

The between-spaces noticed.

They did not comment.

Some things you hold without asking questions. This has always been their position.

He does not look.

This is, the between-spaces think, the first wise thing Odilon has done since arriving. Not the first good thing — the first good thing was following A. Octagon through the membrane, or possibly the apple, or possibly pressing his nose to the side of everything all those weeks ago in the market square when a five-sided creature needed someone to be there. But this is the first wise thing: not looking at the thing that can only exist when you don't.

He sits.

The weight flickers.

Here. Not here. Here. Closer this time — or not closer, because closer implies distance and this thing does not travel; it *manifests*. It is not coming toward Odilon. It is happening near him. The way weather happens near you. The way warmth happens near a creature that has decided to be warm.

The between-spaces catalogue what they can:

The weight, when it is here, is small. Smaller than Odilon. Smaller than A. Octagon's smallest handwriting. But dense, the way a seed is dense, the way a word is dense when it means everything it means all at once instead of one letter at a time.

It leaves something behind. Each flicker, each fractional arrival-and-departure, deposits a trace. Not cedar. Not warmth. *Mass*. A gravity-print on the surface of the nothing, the way Odilon's passages used to leave shapes in the amber. Except these prints don't hold a form. They hold a *weight*. A here-ness. A brief, argumentative insistence on mattering.

And the fold-ground, when the weight is here, *gives*. Not much. Not permanently. A dent — the smallest possible dent, the dent a sleeping child makes in a mattress, the dent that means *something heavy was here* — and then the dent springs back and the ground is smooth again and the Higgs is gone and the only evidence is a golden warmth on the surface that fades even as you notice it. But for that fraction of a fraction of a second, the ground acknowledged a weight. The ground said: *you are real enough to press down on me*. And that is corporeality — not the courtesy the universe extends to a guest, but the kind a guest earns by having mass, however briefly, however impossibly.

Graffiti. The between-spaces land on the word and keep it. Graffiti — quick, unauthorised, expressive, made by something that was here and is gone and wants you to know it. Tags of gravity on the walls of the quantum world, written in a hand that exists for ten to the minus twenty-two seconds and has, in that time, the most to say of anything the between-spaces have encountered.

The between-spaces think: *oh.*

They have thought this before. They thought it in Flatland when a pencil wrote it in the official record and the Provost's fourteenth angle went still. They thought it when Odilon sat in the amber for the first time.

They think it again now, and it means more than it did, because now they know that *oh* is not an exclamation and not a realisation and not even recognition.

*Oh* is the sound of something arriving that you didn't know you were waiting for.

✦

A. Octagon's pencil moves.

She is not writing. She has been not-writing with great discipline, and the between-spaces think this is either the most scientific thing they have ever witnessed or the least, and they suspect the answer is both.

But the pencil moves anyway.

The Fermat pencil, which writes conclusions before questions and answers before experiments and which has been patient with her refusal to read ahead and which is, she increasingly suspects, the kindest instrument she has ever held —

The pencil writes a mark.

Not a word. Not a number. Not in any alphabet she knows, not in the sequential left-to-right of her Flatland script, not even in the backwards-and-around of the pencil's new notation.

A mark.

It is — she stares at it.

It is whole. The way a face is whole. The way a chord is whole. It does not begin at one end and finish at another. It exists all at once, every part of it simultaneous, every stroke containing every other stroke the way a logogram contains its meaning not in the sequence of its parts but in the fact of its being, all at once, itself.

She does not know how to read it.

She knows what it means.

It means: *still here, briefly, always.*

The pencil is not translating A. Octagon. The pencil is translating the Higgs. The graffiti-tag, the golden nova-print, the ten-to-the-minus-twenty-two-second argument for existing — the Fermat pencil has taken what the Higgs wrote on the walls of the world and rendered it in a notation A. Octagon can almost hold. Not read. Not yet. But hold, the way you hold a word in a language you don't speak but whose meaning arrives anyway, through the sound of it, through the weight.

She stares at it for a long time. The accordion trees breathe their muted green. The market hums its thinner hum. The gluon-stalls hold their wares. Odilon sits, not-looking, beside the weight that flickers.

She writes, below the logogram, in her own sequential alphabet, in handwriting that is the best it has ever been and which she no longer hates:

*Observation 30: Something is here.*

*Observation 31: It cannot stay.*

*Observation 32: It keeps coming back.*

*Observation 33: I think it wants us to know.*

She pauses.

The Fermat pencil hovers.

She writes, very carefully, in the smallest letters that are still legible, the way she wrote *hello back* in the market square in Flatland a very long time ago:

*Observation 34: hello.*

In the space beside Odilon, the weight shifts.

For a moment — for a fold, for a breath, for ten to the minus twenty-two seconds that contain, somehow, the entire argument for existing —

It is warm.
