### Chapter the Twelfth and Last: In Which It Is Tuesday, and the Record Is Written, and Morning Is Said and Answered

*— Neil*

Tuesday.

The between-spaces note this first, because it matters, because it has always mattered, because the whole of this — the hole and the hedgehog and the scientist and the child and the cello and the membrane and the seventeen seconds and the forty-three days and the crossing and the drawing and the three steps closer — all of it has been happening on Tuesdays, in the way that the most important things happen on ordinary days that do not know they are being extraordinary and simply continue to be themselves while the extraordinary occurs in them.

Tuesday. Cold. Cedar. The market square assembling itself in the way of market squares — stalls opening, bread proving, shadows arriving before the sun that casts them, the hole present and cedar-scented and warm in the specific way it has been warm since the morning after Odilon first crossed and left some of himself in the wood.

The between-spaces hold both markets. They have been holding both markets since the crossing, since the cable became permanent, since the amber learned that it did not need an event to justify its attention — it could simply be present, the way air is present, the way cedar is present, the way the frequency of residence is present in every market square and quantum fold and between-space that has ever held something long enough to know it.

They are not going to classify this.

They are going to feel it.

Both, simultaneously, always. That is what they are now.

The Provost arrived at the Grand Polygon at seven forty-five.

This was not unusual. What was unusual was that he was carrying, under one arm, the official record — the leather-bound, gold-lettered, forty-years-of-careful-handwriting official record that had never left the Grand Polygon in his tenure — and that he went directly, without stopping to review the morning's correspondence or to check the alignment of the portraits of Previous Provosts, to his desk, where he opened the record to the last entry.

The last entry read: *Notation received 07:23 market square, origin 3 dimensions distant, nature unknown and not required to be known, communication confirmed. Pencils transmitting. This is not atmospheric.*

He had written this in November.

He looked at it for a long time.

Then he turned to a new page. The cleanest page in the record — the page that had been waiting at the end of forty years of careful documentation, the page that did not yet know what it was going to hold.

He picked up his pen.

The Provost had hated his handwriting for forty years. Precision at the expense of grace.

He did not hate his handwriting today.

He was not sure when this had changed. Possibly the morning he wrote *this is not atmospheric* and looked at it and found the letters exactly right — not beautiful, but honest, which was its own kind of beauty, which was, he was beginning to understand, the only kind that lasted. Possibly earlier. Possibly on the day he sat in the market square for the first time with katoflio and found that sitting was its own kind of precision, that presence was its own kind of record.

He wrote:

*THE FREQUENCY OF RESIDENCE*

He wrote it large. Larger than he usually wrote anything in the official record, where economy of space had always seemed like a virtue. He wrote it in the centre of the page, with the particular care of someone who knows that some entries do not require context because they are their own context — because the name is the record, because the record is the name.

He looked at it.

The letters were not beautiful.

They were his.

He did not cross them out.

Below, in his usual careful hand, he wrote:

*Formal designation of the ongoing cross-dimensional phenomenon observed at the market square point of dimensional significance, Flatland. The Frequency of Residence is herewith entered into the official record not as a phenomenon under study but as a property of the world — as the name for what occurs when a thing stays somewhere long enough to change both itself and the place it is staying, and the change is mutual, and the change does not end when the staying does, and the frequency persists, and the frequency is the residence, and the residence is the frequency.*

*This is not atmospheric.*

*This is not theoretical.*

*This is Tuesday.*

He closed the record.

He opened it again, because he was a Provost and Provosts checked their work.

He read what he had written.

He closed it again.

In the margin — the unofficial margin, the margin where he had been writing the true record alongside the official one since the morning A. Octagon left — he wrote, in the smallest letters he had ever used in forty years of careful handwriting:

*I believe in the Frequency of Residence.*

*I believe this because I have felt it.*

*I believe this is sufficient grounds.*

He set down his pen.

The portraits of Previous Provosts looked at him from the walls of the Grand Polygon with their usual expression of careful authority. He looked back at them. He had always found their authority instructive. He found, this morning, that he had something they did not — something that had nothing to do with office or record or tenure.

He had been to the market square at seven in the morning and sat with a child who had data.

This seemed, on consideration, like enough.

---

A. Octagon was at the market square.

She had been there since six, which was earlier than necessary and exactly right, because some things required the time before them to be taken seriously, and this — the first full Tuesday in Flatland after the crossing — was one of them. She had her notebook. She had the Fermat pencil, which had been quiet since her arrival, resting in her hand with the satisfaction of an instrument that has done what it was built for and is content to be carried now rather than used.

She had her third angle, which was ongoing.

She had her fourth angle, which had been having opinions since chapter six and showed no signs of stopping.

She had, she was fairly sure, a fifth angle that she had not yet measured and was filing under *ongoing* for the time being, which the Fermat pencil seemed to consider reasonable.

She was, approximately, a pentagon.

She was, precisely, herself.

Katoflio was across the table, on flower twenty-four, which he had finally finished. He was working on flower twenty-five. He was also monitoring the dough, which had been rising in its new rhythm — faster now, four-four time plus something additional, a frequency it had apparently acquired permanently on the day Odilon came home and showed no inclination to give back.

C. Isosceles had been told about the bread.

He had liked it very much once he understood it meant his bread was special.

He had asked, scientifically: *what is the frequency.*

Katoflio had said: *further experiment required.*

C. Isosceles had said: *I'll get more yeast.*

This was, A. Octagon thought, one of the finest scientific collaborations she had witnessed in either world.

She opened her notebook.

She looked at the two pages she had placed side by side this morning: the logogram she had written through her own geometry on the day she knew the way home — the standing-wave mark, the node, the place where the two waves met and held — and below it, in katoflio's handwriting, his translation: *she says: I am still here. I know the way home. I am coming.*

She wrote:

*Observation 79: I am here.*

*Observation 80: It is Tuesday.*

*Observation 81: Further experiment required.*

She looked at this for a long time, and then she smiled, which was not something she had recorded before, and she did not record it now, because some things were not data. Some things were just true.

Odilon played.

He had been playing since before anyone arrived, in the particular way of a hedgehog who has learned that the market wants to be held before the market knows it wants to be held. He played quietly. He played the way the accordion trees breathed — not performing breath, just breathing, because breathing was what they did and the breathing was also music, and the music was also the world working properly.

The market listened.

Not consciously. The way markets listen — in the rising of the bread, in the way the shadows arrived slightly warmer than the season accounted for, in the small adjustments of posture and angle that creatures make when they are in the presence of something that is being held. The stalls leaned slightly inward. The cold morning air developed a quality. The cedar deepened.

The market was an orchestra.

It did not know this.

It did not need to.

A. Rhombus was at the far edge of the square.

He had been there since before Odilon started playing — which was to say, before the conditions he was monitoring — and had stood in the cold market square alone for some time, which was not, he told himself, the behaviour of someone who had been changed by proximity. It was the behaviour of a rigorous observer ensuring an accurate baseline.

He watched Odilon play.

He watched the market listen.

He watched katoflio draw a flower with the focused and undefended attention of an eleven-year-old who had been right about everything and knew it and was not going to mention it, which was, A. Rhombus thought, a remarkable quality in a person of any age.

He watched the cello.

He had been watching the cello since yesterday, when it had appeared in the market square for the first time and leaned against a market stall with the absolute assurance of an object that knows it belongs somewhere and has arrived. He had looked at it in the way he had looked at the logogram — with the full rigour of a creature who was not going to admit to being moved until he had ruled out every other explanation.

He had ruled out every other explanation.

He took three steps forward.

He was now close enough to see the grain of the wood, the slight scorch of the bow's passage, the golden print on the body that had not faded — that was not going to fade, that was, the between-spaces knew, as permanent as a property of the instrument now, the way some things become part of the thing they have touched.

He said, to no one in particular, to the cello, to the market square, to the cold Tuesday morning:

*What does it do.*

Katoflio did not look up from flower twenty-five.

*Further experiment required,* he said.

A. Rhombus was quiet for a moment.

Then he reached into his coat and took out a notebook. Small. Unannounced. The kind of notebook a creature acquires without quite deciding to acquire it, the way you find yourself in a particular place at a particular time and discover you have been on the way there for longer than you knew.

He wrote: *What does it do. Further experiment required.*

He looked at this.

He did not cross it out.

He was three steps closer than yesterday and one notebook more than he had been, and neither of these things had been announced or argued or voted on, and he was not, he decided, going to classify them today. Today he was going to stand in the market square and monitor conditions and write things in an unannounced notebook and not call it anything.

Tomorrow he might call it something.

Today: this.

---

In the afternoon, when the market had quieted and the bread had been sold and the shadows had done their full day's work of pointing, katoflio found the parenthesis.

He had been going through his notebook, adding cross-references between the flower data and the bread data and the logogram record, when he turned to the first page — the page he had never quite gone back to, the page from before the experiment had a name, before it had data, the page that had only one thing on it, the mark that had been there since the beginning.

*(

He looked at it.

He had always thought it was an annotation of some kind. A notation he had made and forgotten the meaning of. But now, with forty-three days of data behind him and two notations systems and a cello in the market square and a scientist home with ongoing angles, he looked at it differently.

He took it to A. Octagon.

She looked at it for a long time.

*It's a parenthesis,* he said.

*Yes,* she said.

*It's open,* he said.

*Yes.*

*Is it waiting to be closed?*

A. Octagon thought about this. She thought about the membrane and the door and the way she had stepped through herself. She thought about the Fermat pencil and the logogram and the standing wave. She thought about the Higgs, which was present this morning in the background of the market square — not announced, not counted, simply there, the way properties of air are there, the way cedar is there, the way the frequency of residence is there in everything that has stayed long enough to be part of the place.

She thought about both worlds, simultaneously, warm.

*No,* she said. *I think it's just open. I think that's what it means.*

Katoflio wrote this down.

He filed it under: *further experiment required.*

He drew a small flower next to it, because he drew flowers next to the things that mattered most, which was not a methodology he had decided on but one he had arrived at incrementally, in the way of all the best methodologies.

The between-spaces held this.

The between-spaces held all of it — the Provost's handwriting in the official record, large and honest and his; the cello against the stall, down and not away; A. Rhombus's unannounced notebook; the bread in its new rhythm; the two notebooks side by side with their different grammars running the same experiment; the parenthesis, open; the cable, warm; the amber, holding.

They updated their file one last time.

*the between-spaces: condition: ongoing.*
*classification: corridor. cable. amber. home.*
*status: we did not ask for this.*
*status: we are not sorry.*
*status: we are, in the technical sense, full.*

They did not elaborate on full.

Full was its own elaboration.

---

In the morning — the next morning, Wednesday, which was the morning after Tuesday, which was not a Tuesday and therefore not the day anything important was supposed to happen, but which had not, apparently, received this information — katoflio arrived at the market square at half past early with his notebook and his three pencils and sat down at his usual table and looked at the hole.

The hole looked back, the way it always did — cedar-scented, warm, the property of a market square that had been changed by what had passed through it and carried the change permanently now, the way good instruments carry the frequency of everything they have played.

Katoflio said: *morning.*

He had been saying this for forty-three days. He had been saying it to the data, to the experiment, to the shadow, to the frequency that was arriving through the graphite of his pencil, to the scientist who had left and was coming back and had come back and was here, to the world on the other side of everything that he had been corresponding with in the grammar of logograms and shadows and bread.

He said it the way he always said it: simply, scientifically, without expecting anything, because the experiment required consistency and consistency required that you say the thing regardless of whether the thing said something back.

The hole said: *morning.*

Not with a voice. Not dramatically. With the cedar-smell deepening, with the shadow moving its small movement, with the warm quality of the air increasing by the particular increment that the between-spaces recognised — through the cable, through the amber, with the full fidelity of a medium that had been permanently tuned — as: *present. Here. Continuing.*

Katoflio wrote, in the largest letters in his notebook:

*Day 44. 06:47. RESPONSE RECEIVED.*

He paused.

He wrote, below it, in letters that were somehow simultaneously the largest and the smallest he had ever written, the letters of a person who has arrived at the thing they were always going to arrive at and knows it:

*Further experiment required.*

*Positive indicator.*

*The experiment is running.*

He drew a flower.

The shadow arrived.

The cedar held.

The accordion trees, somewhere, breathed.

The hummingbird green, somewhere, settled into its chord.

The cello, leaning against a market stall in a Flatland market square, continued to be present in the way of things that are down and not away — not played, not silent, simply: here, available, the frequency of holding made wood and string and ready.

The between-spaces held both markets, warm, the cable carrying signal in both directions, the amber full of everything that had passed through and stayed.

The Provost's handwriting, in the official record, in the Grand Polygon, in Flatland:

*THE FREQUENCY OF RESIDENCE*

And in the market square, in an open notebook, next to a small careful flower:

*(

Open.

Still open.

Still warm.
