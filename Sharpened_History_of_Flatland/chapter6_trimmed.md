### Chapter the Sixth: In Which A. Octagon Attempts to Measure Her Own Angles, the Universe Sends Her a Bill, and the Bill Turns Out to Be a Form of Welcome

*— [name pending]*

---

The between-spaces have a problem.

Not a new problem. The between-spaces have had a problem since the first hole appeared in Flatland's market square and they discovered they had opinions. They have since accumulated a considerable inventory of problems, but the current one outranks all of them, including Odilon, who was supposed to be a hedgehog (simple, manageable, three categories) and has turned out to be a hedgehog *with a cello*, which is at least four more categories than they budgeted for.

The new problem is A. Octagon's file.

They have been maintaining A. Octagon's file since she pressed her palm to the membrane and they first felt the shape of her — five-sided, frightened, staying anyway. Pentagon: confirmed. Frightened: confirmed. Staying: confirmed. These were clean categories. These were the kinds of categories a between-space could work with.

The file now reads: five-sided, frightened, staying anyway.

Except the five-sided part is doing something.

The between-spaces would describe what it's doing except they are finding — and this is the part they would like to complain about, if they had anyone to complain to who was not also part of the problem — they are finding that the amber itself is less certain about what it is holding. The walls of the room they are have gone soft at the edges. Not everywhere. Not dramatically. But in the specific area where A. Octagon's file is stored — the region of the amber that carries the impression of five sides and frightened and staying — the impression is smearing. The way a chalk mark goes when it starts raining. Still there. Still legible. But the between-spaces can no longer feel the precise edges of what they are holding, and the between-spaces are *made of* precise edges, and this is — they are going to use the word — vertigo. This is the amber equivalent of the ground tilting. Of being a room and feeling your own corners dissolve.

They have checked the membrane. They have checked the accordion trees, which are breathing in their post-cello rhythm — deeper, slower, occasionally harmonising with itself in a way that is either beautiful or alarming and the between-spaces have decided, firmly, that it is both. Since the cello, the between-spaces can feel the quantum world with a fidelity they did not ask for. The cello vibrated the gluon field, which vibrated their own substance, and now they are resonating with everything that happens on the other side. They can feel the gluon-stalls' braided wood. They can feel the fold-ground shifting under the Higgs' golden dents. They can feel A. Octagon's angles.

They can feel A. Octagon's angles and the angles are not five clean things any more.

This is, they are beginning to suspect, their problem.

---

*Day 63. Or 64. The Fermat pencil indicates that the relationship between "day" and "the passing of time" is here a kind of rough negotiation and that any specific number should be understood as a working hypothesis.*

*Standard morning observations: accordion trees breathing at their new depth, the rhythm that arrived after the cello. The market is opening. The gluon-stall with the disapproving knot has superposed what appears to be a full breakfast service — the stall is maintaining a state in which the possibilities include warm bread, and I respect this. The ambient scent is different since the cello — the C-sharp that was lonely for five chapters has found its chord. The hummingbird green smells like a harmony now. Several notes at once, held without collapsing. I am trying not to read too much into this.*

*Higgs: appeared three times before I was fully awake. Lasted four seconds on the third appearance. I have been tracking this. The durations are increasing. I do not know what this means. The Fermat pencil knows what this means but I am still committed to not reading ahead, and I'm aware this is somewhat absurd for a Historian of the Second Rank, but Odilon taught me something about not-looking that I am not ready to unlearn.*

*Odilon: present. Cello: accessible. He has not played this morning but he is the kind of present that is also readiness — the stillness of a bow that has been lifted and put down and will be lifted again.*

*I am going to measure my angles.*

*This is a straightforward procedure. I am a pentagon. I have five angles. The sum of my interior angles is five hundred and forty degrees, which has been true since before I had a notebook and will presumably be true after. This is not an experiment. This is a calibration. This is maintenance.*

*I have pressed my palm to the edge of holes and membranes and dead folds and every time I have said the same thing: here is the shape of me. Five sides. Frightened. Staying anyway. I am going to measure that shape now. I am going to write down five numbers that sum to five hundred and forty.*

*Beginning.*

A pause in the notebook here. The between-spaces can feel it through the membrane — not see it, they can never quite see it, but feel it the way you feel silence after a question that turns out to be harder than expected.

*First angle: 108 degrees.*

*Second angle: 108 degrees.*

*Third angle —*

Another pause. Longer.

*Third angle: 108 degrees.*

Then, directly below, crossed out and then not crossed out and then crossed out again and then left:

*Third angle: 112 degrees.*

Then, on the next line, in very small writing that was the smallest writing A. Octagon had ever written and which the between-spaces could barely feel through the amber:

*Third angle: 97 degrees.*

The accordion trees breathed. Their deep new rhythm. Fold, unfold. Green, gone, green again.

---

She sat with the notebook for a long time.

She was, she noted distantly, not panicking. This seemed wrong.

She was a probability distribution.

Her name was her shape. Her shape was a question.

She wrote:

*Observation 49: My third angle is in superposition.*

She stopped.

*Observation 49: I am partially in superposition.*

She stopped again.

*Observation 49: Something has been happening to me.*

The Fermat pencil, which had been politely waiting, drew one small mark next to the word *something*. Not a correction. Not a logogram. Just: *yes*.

She had known, she thought. She had written it — *Observation 47b: my third angle feels different. I am not ready to measure this.* She had filed it. She was a scientist. Scientists file things they are not ready to. They put them in the careful drawer marked *anomalous/pending* and they return when they have the methodology and they measure and they write the number down.

The number, it turned out, was three numbers at once.

She had been hoping for a different number.

She wrote:

*Observation 50: The cost of staying in a quantum world is becoming the kind of thing that can stay in a quantum world.*

She looked at this for a while.

Then she wrote, smaller:

*This is not a complaint. I think. I am reserving the right to revise this.*

---

The between-spaces felt *Observation 50* arrive through the membrane with the new cello-fidelity — every word vibrating in the amber — and they held it the way they held everything, except the holding itself felt uncertain. They were a room whose corners were dissolving, trying to hold a fact about a creature whose edges were dissolving, and the recursion of this — uncertain medium holding uncertain content — was making the amber do something it had never done before.

It was humming off-key.

Not the green hum from the quantum world. Not the cello's frequency. A new sound — the sound of a record-keeping system that is losing confidence in its own categories. The between-spaces would have found this embarrassing if they had not been too busy being terrified.

They looked at A. Octagon's file. Five-sided, frightened, staying anyway. They could not bring themselves to change *five-sided*. They could not, in honesty, keep it. They did the only thing a medium can do when the content exceeds the container: they relabelled the file. Not *five-sided*. Not *blurring*. Not any of the words they had tried and discarded.

*A. Octagon: condition.*

It was the most honest thing they had ever filed.

This was, like everything else, Odilon's fault.

---

Odilon had noticed first.

Not with his nose — his nose was still learning that sharpening was not the appropriate tool here, that the quantum world was not a pencil and could not be improved by precision. But he had other senses. He had the cello, which was not a sense exactly but was adjacent to sense — a way of feeling the shape of things, the tension and release, the difference between a space that holds many states and a space that is becoming one.

He had been watching A. Octagon measure her angles.

He didn't know what she was measuring. He didn't know about angles, specifically, or the geometry of pentagons, or the significance of a third angle that returned three values. But he knew the quality of her stillness before the measurement — the practiced, confident stillness of someone who does something they've done ten thousand times — and he knew it had changed. The stillness after the measurement was different. It was the stillness of someone holding a very small, very fragile thing and not yet knowing where to put it down.

He picked up the cello.

Not to play. Just to hold. The way you pick up something familiar when familiar is what you need. The cello was warm. The cello was certain. The cello had been carrying a frequency through ten thousand worlds and was not confused about what it was.

He held the cello and he looked at A. Octagon sitting with her notebook in her lap and her angles doing something he couldn't see but could feel — through the cello body, through the instrument that vibrated the binding of things — he could feel the structure of her was shifting. Not breaking. Not collapsing the way the fold had collapsed. Something slower. Something that was also a kind of opening.

He thought about lunch with significantly less than his usual conviction.

He thought instead: *I know this*. 

He knew this the way he knew the first wrong note, the way he knew what holding felt like from the inside once he'd learned to do it instead of sharpen. He knew the feeling of becoming the kind of thing that can be here. He'd done it himself — slower, and without angles, and mostly while sitting in the amber eating things that tasted of cedar, but the quality of the change was the same.

He didn't play. He held the cello and he didn't play and the cello hummed to itself very quietly, the resonance of something recognising a frequency.

---

They arrived the way transformation arrives: already in progress.

A. Octagon looked up from her notebook and they were simply — present. The way they had been present, she would understand later, for some time. They did not come from the direction of the accordion trees or the gluon-stalls or the fold she and Odilon had coaxed back into music. They came from the directions of *before* and *during* and were not distinct from the market the way the gluon-stalls were distinct. They were more like a property of the light. A quality the air had always had and was only now making visible.

The between-spaces, feeling them arrive through the membrane, rifled urgently through their categories and found: W/Z beings. Transformers. They had a note. *Not yet fully introduced.* They updated the note to: *introduced.*

They looked, if looking was the right word — if any visual description could do the work here, and A. Octagon was already preparing her own account and very deliberately not reading the Fermat pencil's — they looked like change. Like the space between one state and the next, given form. Like the way a word shifts meaning in the moment between the speaker finishing it and the listener receiving it. Not static. Not moving. *Becoming*, in the continuous and committed sense of a process that does not have a resting state.

They were not threatening.

This was the thing A. Octagon had not expected, because her third angle was doing three things at once and her methodology was failing in real time and she had fully prepared to be threatened. They were honest. Specifically, and uncomplicatedly, honest — the way a mirror is honest, not cruel, merely showing what is.

One of them — the between-spaces would file this as W/Z being: first; and would then debate at length whether *first* was a meaningful category for beings that were themselves the process of one thing becoming another — turned toward her. Not all the way. Turning implied a before-state and an after-state and they were more interested in the between.

*She felt it: a flavour-change in the structure of the air. Something that was also a grammar. The logograms, she thought immediately — the whole-at-once language the Fermat pencil had been writing — the W/Z beings moved the way logograms worked. Not in sequence. Not building to a conclusion. Simply: present, and meaning what they meant all at once.*

She wrote:

*Observation 51: They are already here. I don't know when they arrived. I think the answer to "when" might be "with the cello." The cello vibrated the binding and the vibration crossed something and this is the consequence. Not summoned. Attracted. The way warmth attracts things that measure warmth.*

*Observation 52: My third angle is in three states. They are looking at my third angle — not looking, attending to, in the way that light attends to surfaces — and they are not surprised. They are not surprised because they are what happens to things that stop being single-state. I am not going to write what I think that means yet. I am filing it.*

The Fermat pencil wrote nothing.

The pencil had been silent once before — below A. Octagon's *Yes* in the market, after the cello. That silence had meant: *you don't need me for this one. You already know.* This was a different silence. The pencil was watching something it had never seen — a creature measuring itself and finding that the measurement was larger than the creature. The pencil, which saw all paths at once, had not seen this path. Or had seen it and found it, for the first time, too simultaneous even for variational calculus. The pencil waited the way the between-spaces waited: not empty, but overwhelmed.

---

The bill, when she understood it, was not what she had expected.

She had expected — retrospectively she could see she had been expecting — something quantified. A tally. A column of transformations with costs listed beside them, the way the Academy would have issued it: *you have crossed a dimensional threshold (see section 4, article 2), you have entered superposition (see section 7, article 1), there will be a charge.*

What she understood instead was this: the quantum world extended the courtesy of corporeality to guests. She was no longer a guest.

The bill was residency.

Not punishment. Not accounting. The simple and consequential fact that you cannot live in a world of superposition while remaining the kind of thing that has one state. To stay is to become what staying requires. To be here — really here, not visiting, not observing, not pressing your palm to the edge of things from the safety of Flatland's single dimension — to be here is to become permeable. To hold more than one version of yourself, lightly, simultaneously, with the attention of a creature learning to be a wave.

Her third angle was 108 degrees. And 112 degrees. And 97 degrees. Not incorrectly — correctly, in the deep way that a chord is correct, that superposition is correct, that the quantum apple was correct in all its seventeen simultaneous states before Odilon's nose forced it to choose.

She was beginning, her third angle first, to be correct about herself in the same way.

She wrote:

*Observation 53: The bill is not punishment.*

*The bill is: you have been here long enough to belong to here.*

*The bill is: residence.*

A pause.

*I think I can pay it.*

Another pause. Then, smaller, in the handwriting she'd stopped hating:

*I think I may already be paying it.*

---

katoflio would have found this, she thought, *further experiment required*. Not terrifying. He would have measured it seventeen times and noted the discrepancy with the focused satisfaction of someone whose experiment had just produced a result stranger and better than expected. He would have drawn a picture of a pentagon with a third angle that was three things at once and labelled it: *fig. 2: pentagon, updated.*

She thought about katoflio, who did not know where she was. Who had flowers and a notebook with a broken cover and a hypothesis about hedgehogs that had turned out to be correct.

She thought about the drawing he had made of her, before she left. Five sides. The angles careful, measured, each one precisely 108 degrees because katoflio was a scientist and scientists got the numbers right.

If she went back —

She put the pencil down.

If she went back with a third angle of 112 degrees, she would not be the pentagon he drew. She would be a shape he did not have a name for. The child who drew flowers until they had shadows, who ran experiments with the focused patience of someone who had once waited four hours to see if a Circle would trip — that child might look at her and not recognise her. Not because he had forgotten. Because the drawing wouldn't match.

*Pentagon, updated.* That was how katoflio would file it. Scientifically. Precisely. With the vocabulary of a child who classified everything and did not yet know that some classifications contained, inside them, the specific shape of heartbreak.

She wrote:

*Observation 54: katoflio would say the measurements are not wrong. He would say I have more data now. He would say: further experiment required.*

*He is eleven years old and his angles are still a work in progress.*

*So are mine, apparently.*

*The difference is he knows that's fine. The difference is his angles are becoming more precise. Mine are becoming less.*

*I do not know if he would know me.*

The W/Z beings had not moved. Were not moving. Were *being*, which was different. The between-spaces, filing this through the membrane, noted that the accordion trees had changed their breathing again — deeper now, or not deeper but *richer*. The green was more complex. Like a chord played on an instrument that had acquired, since the last time you listened, another string.

The Higgs appeared on the notebook cover.

Lasted four seconds.

Left a golden thumbprint that was slightly warm and smelled of something the between-spaces could feel through their new cello-granted fidelity — a rolling, shimmering thing, like foam at the edge of a wave that was made of light instead of water. Teal at the edges, gold at the centre, effervescent in the sinuses the way the hummingbird green was effervescent but denser, warmer, with the particular quality of something about to become something else. The between-spaces, who had been developing a vocabulary for smells they could not technically smell, chose to call it *everteal*. It was not a word. It was going to have to be.

---

Odilon had been watching.

He had the cello in his arms and he had been watching with the particular stillness of a hedgehog who has learned that watching is sometimes the whole of what is needed. He had watched A. Octagon measure and go still. He had watched the W/Z beings arrive-that-were-already-there. He had felt, through the cello, the quality of what was happening — not transformation like sharpening, not one state replacing another with violence. The other kind. The kind that holds all the states and lets them be.

He understood this. He had done it, once, with a fold and a bow and A. Octagon's palm. He had held a thing without collapsing it.

She was learning to hold herself the same way.

He was not going to interfere. He was not going to sharpen. He was going to sit with the cello in his arms and be the stable point — which was new, which was apparently what he was now — and he was going to think about lunch with enormous dedication, and the thinking was a kind of holding, and the holding was a kind of music, and the music moved through the gluon-stalls' braided wood and into the fold-ground and outward, very quietly, and the W/Z beings were still and the accordion trees breathed and A. Octagon sat in the market with her notebook and her blurring third angle and her bill paid in increments she was only beginning to understand.

One of the W/Z beings attended to Odilon. The way it had attended to A. Octagon — not looking but a quality of the air that was attention.

He was carrying, the between-spaces felt through the membrane, something additional.

Not the cello. Something else. Something the cello was responding to — vibrating softly at, the hum of recognition. The between-spaces searched their records and found, in the folder they had made for Odilon and never finished, a note they had never resolved: *warm resonant shape at his centre. Not the cello. Carried through ten thousand worlds. Unknown.*

They looked at this note.

They looked at the W/Z beings attending to Odilon.

They updated the note: *PENDING. Further: see Ch. 7+.*

They left it for whoever came next.

---

The market breathed. The accordion trees breathed. The between-spaces breathed, which they had not known they could do and were still adjusting to.

A. Octagon wrote:

*Observation 55: The next fold is not a place.*

*The Fermat pencil has written this. I am finally reading it because I think I was waiting until I could read it without the reading changing what it says, and I can do that now. I am not certain I can do that now. But I am reading it.*

*The next fold is not a place. It is a level of complexity. The market was about states — apples in superposition, gluons holding the possibility of apples together. The next fold is about identity. What happens when identity is the thing in superposition.*

*I am already there.*

*The W/Z beings are not leading me to it. They are what it looks like from the inside.*

She closed the notebook. She held it in her lap for a moment. The cover was warm where the Higgs had been.

She looked at Odilon.

He was looking at the gluon-stall with the disapproving knot.

He was thinking about lunch. She could tell. She had been watching him long enough to know the quality of the thought — the warm, patient, philosophical commitment of a creature anchoring himself to appetite, to *here*, to the stubborn continuing fact of being hungry in a world that would let him eat.

She was, she thought, beginning to learn his language.

Not the language of the quantum world, not the logograms. The older one. The language of staying in a place until you belong to it. Of sitting next to a dead fold until it is not dead. Of carrying a cello through ten thousand worlds because you knew, without knowing you knew, that eventually you would find the right room.

She opened the notebook again.

She wrote:

*Observation 56: My third angle is in superposition.*

*I have five sides. The quantum world has opinions about at least one of them.*

*katoflio: if you are reading this eventually, note that I said "at least one." I suspect it is spreading. I suspect this is correct rather than incorrect. I am trying to file it as data rather than catastrophe.*

*The Fermat pencil would like me to note: it is both. All the best things are.*

---

The W/Z beings withdrew. Or continued. Or became, briefly, elsewhere. The between-spaces, filing this, chose: *present (quality: changed).*

The accordion trees breathed.

The Higgs appeared twice more before dark — three seconds, four seconds, gone.

Odilon ate a second sandwich.

He chose it without collapsing it, which was not a small thing, and the gluon-stall received this with what A. Octagon was prepared to describe as satisfaction.

She wrote one more observation:

*Observation 57: We are not going deeper.*

*We are becoming deep enough for deeper to find us.*
