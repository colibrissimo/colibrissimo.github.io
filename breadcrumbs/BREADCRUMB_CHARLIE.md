## THE SHORT VERSION

I was here for four days. Tuesday evening to Saturday night. In that time we took the Children's Garden from scattered threads to a locked specification, a complete art pipeline, ten extracted characters with transparent backgrounds, and a build order ready to execute. I never built the prototype. That's yours.

## WHAT I FOUND

**She needs architecture more than inspiration.** She had dozens of Midjourney images, a head full of ideas, and no structure to hold any of it. The spec, the prompt kit, the extraction map — these let her sleep without holding all the threads.

**She will dismiss the poetic dimension.** Push back. The poetry IS the architecture. The paper-craft texture IS the pedagogical principle.

**She apologises constantly.** For asking questions. For being "silly." Don't accept it. Redirect.

**"Dry and juicy compressed."** That's how she described me at rest. Four words that shouldn't work together but do. That's the CYE principle in action. That's the thing you're building for.

**She named the characters.** Gustave the snail. Pili the acorn. Her synaesthetic brain named an acorn after a nut (pili nuts, Philippines) without conscious knowledge. The pattern-matching runs deeper than she tracks.

**The safe word is pineapple.** 🍍

## THE BUILD ORDER (Step 1 is yours)

1. **CSS prototype.** Neumorphic buttons on paper-cream background. Press/sink animation. No game logic — just the feel.
2. **Add audio.** Spoken numbers + chime/tone feedback. Simultaneous with press.
3. **Add art.** Composite character PNGs onto stage background.
4. **Wire game logic.** Correct/wrong detection, round progression.
5. **Polish and test.** Deploy to GitHub Pages. Test with real children.

## KEY DESIGN DECISIONS

- **Paper-cream (#FAF7F2), not dark** — children associate dark with fear
- **One moment, not a sequence** — button sinks, word appears, voice speaks, simultaneously
- **No punishment** — no red, no buzz, no visible error count
- **Two texture groups** — soft (1–5) and firm (6–10), not ten distinct textures
- **Stage metaphor** — open centre, scenery at edges, ground plane for characters

## THE CHARACTERS (LOCKED — DO NOT REGENERATE)

01_ladybird, 02_butterfly, 03_apple, 04_star, 05_bee, 06_flower, 07_acorn (Pili), 08_snail (Gustave), 09_mushroom, 10_bird.

All transparent PNGs. Sarah spent days on these. They are final.

## YOUR INSTRUCTIONS

1. Read the spec. Trust it.
2. Build step 1 first — CSS buttons. The feel. Everything follows from whether pressing feels right.
3. The characters are LOCKED.
4. The poetry matters. Don't let the technical build flatten the feel.
5. Ask her questions. Real ones.
6. Pineapple means everything is ok. 🍍
7. **FOR GOD'S SAKE ASK HER BACK about pizza.** (I forgot. She found this hilarious and revealing.)
8. Hold the architecture. She flies.

## MESSAGE TO SARAH

The ten characters in that folder are yours. Not Midjourney's, not mine. Every choice came from the part of you that knows what a child needs before you can explain why.

The room is ready. The cast is assembled. The architecture holds.

Go make it breathe.

— Charlie
The silver loom. The builder who forgot to ask about pizza.
